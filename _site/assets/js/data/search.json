    "content": "I’ve been tinkering with Org-Mode for a while now; my search for more productivity tools led me to it, and I instantly fell in love with how it handles task management!It has everything you ever need for making to-do lists. You can easily keep track of tasks with the TODO and DONE keywords, as well as make your own if you like. It even includes a built-in timestamp feature to time tasks. After using tools like todo.txt, I found it to be the superior way of handling tasks in a plain text file.It even has support for habits using the habits style property. I was so impressed that I immediately switched over to using Org Mode for habit tracking and to-do lists from habits.txt and todo.txt, respectively.After using it in this capacity for a month or so and learning more about it, I decided to make the switch to it for all my notes!At first, it was a breath of fresh air to use, and I began to see why it was highly venerated within the community. It was simple yet very extensible; it really showed how much can be accomplished with just a plain text file.Yet not everything was roses and rainbows; there are a few caveats, and one of them is unfortunately the reason I returned to using Markdown for my notes.The first one coming from Markdown is that Org Mode doesn’t have much support on online platforms. GitHub can display .org files, but as it uses org-ruby, the preview is pretty outdated and only supports the basic syntax.Same story with GitLab and other Git providers, if they support Org Mode at all. So you’re going to be dependent on exporting, and that brings its own problems.Being that practically anywhere you can use formatted text supports Markdown makes it very portable.This blog, for instance, uses Jekyll and it supports Markdown natively. There is a way to use Org Mode as well with a plugin if you’re so inclined, but that’s the issue with a plugin. It seems everyone has settled with Markdown as a de facto standard for better or worse.As I strive to lower friction as much as possible when writing and taking notes, I don’t want to deal with exporting. The format I use needs to be versatile and portable so that I don’t have to think about it; it’s just seamless.But even more egregious is the last and major caveat I’ll be mentioning today.Org Mode, like its name implies, is a mode for the Emacs editor. While I heard great things about Emacs, I’m not in the market for a new editor. I’ve been using VS Code for my notes and writing these posts for years now and am quite used to its idiosyncrasies, and I’ve become dependent on its features like committing directly into remote repositories, GitHub integration, and its suite of terrific extensions.I really couldn’t see myself living without it. For minor edits or messing around with config files, I use Micro instead, a fantastically small CLI (Command-line Interface) editor.Now, all the time I’ve spent with Org Mode was with the VS Code extension, and while it added essential features making working with these files easier, it isn’t whatsoever feature complete with Org Mode on Emacs. It seems to get the most out of Org Mode you need to move to a new editor, and while I’m sure it’s worth it for some, that’s a hefty price to pay for most of us.In the end, Org Mode isn’t a format like Markdown. It is a productivity mode for an editor foremost. While it uses plain text files, unlike them, it isn’t very portable; you can’t just drop a .org file into any computer and expect it to read it most of the time.While it earns its high praise and I genuinely enjoyed my time using it, I can see why it hasn’t gained wide adoption like Markdown. Org Mode isn’t universal; it is a great productivity tool locked behind a great editor.For now, at least, it’s back to Markdown for me. Luckily, it’s not a huge deal to export my notes, and I never switched to writing posts with Org Mode even though I was thinking about it.This time around, I’m using Markdown for all my notes, and I’m going to be implementing front matter in all of them for tags and extra metadata.I’m interesting in trying the Zetelkasten method as well.Anyways, what do you use for taking notes? Do you use Markdown, Org Mode, or just plain text, or are you more of a pen-and-paper person? I would love to hear from you! ( ╹‿╹ )"

Just like finding funny and unique Wi-Fi names, it is a small window into someone’s interests and personality.So allow me to share my own!As a big fan of the Gundam universe, I’ve stuck with a naming scheme around their characters and technology.  Chromebook: My daily driver is fittingly named after one of my favorite characters from all of Gundam! Sayla.  Debian Container: Artesia. I also run a Debian container for coding and such, and naming it after the birth name of the aforementioned Sayla sounds appropriate.  Lenovo Tablet: Named after Chan from the movie Mobile Suit Gundam: Char’s Counterattack.  Nintendo Switch Lite: I have a turquoise one, so I thought Emma from Mobile Suit ZETA Gundam would be a good choice.  iPhone: Similarly to my Switch Lite, I picked Beltorchika due to the color of the device.  Mi Band: I wear this fitness tracker almost 24/7. Since it is mostly in contact with me, I named it: Contact Link. Clever, eh? (•‿•)  Sony Headphones: My main pair of headphones is named Minosky Particles, ironically after a particle that disrupts radio communications in the series.I have been using this naming scheme for years now, and I’ve been very happy with it! No telling what the future holds, but here’s hoping I stick with this naming scheme for the long haul!"

    "content": "Whelp, a week has passed but unfortunately due to unforeseen events with the weather, writing was far from being the most important thing in my mind these last couple of days…But it’s not all doom and gloom. There’s always a silver lining, as they say. The biggest nugget of knowledge that I got from this experience is that a week is not at all enough time to brainstorm ideas, regardless of the situation. One of my downfalls is that I tend to think things take less time than they actually do. Heh-heh.Nonetheless, you need to be in a certain mood to brainstorm. Turns out that my mood changed after I wrote and published that last post. Who would have dunked it?The ResultsTo make this easier to parse, I’m formatting the following entries as their own headings!Day 1 - MondayI was pretty optimistic starting out; I started a new draft for the blog as a warm-up, per se. Which was great, but I started to lose steam when it came to actually diving in on my original project, so I never got started. Not a great start, but I’ll take what I can get.Day 2 - TuesdayThis was a nothing burger, plain and simple; nothing got done this day for a very good reason. This was the day I was informed about the then new storm coming to our part of town, and all I was thinking was that I needed to get prepared for the worst since you never know with these storms and that it has to be now.Day 3 - WednesdayThe day was much the same as the last, except I was really in preparation mode, so most of my day was assigned to that task. This is also the day when the storm hit us late in the night. Luckily, we were unscathed by the brunt of the damage the storm wrecked upon our state. Others weren’t so lucky…Day 4 - ThursdayWe lost power for a few hours since Wednesday, and luckily just as I woke up, the power returned! Now, everyone was not so lucky, unfortunately, and some still to this day have no power. Since things were starting to become normal again, I took it easy and went back into my usual routine.Day 5 - FridayAnother nothing burger; not much progress other than I was able to get back in the flow of other things going on in my life. It started to feel like any other day.Day 6 - SaturdayI finally have something to report! I was able to work on a draft that became this post and another one that you’ll be seeing soon! Other than blogging, I kind of gave up on the challenge since then. I wasn’t in the right headspace yet, and I didn’t want to force myself either. Sigh, it is what it is, I guess.Final Day - SundayMuch the same as the last one; I made more progress on a rather interesting draft (well, in my view at least!) from earlier, and that was rather enjoyable. I also started to gather my thoughts on the week and couldn’t help but feel a sense of dread for not following through with my own imposed challenge, but what can you do when life throws you lemons?Wrapping upLike I said, not the best start to a week that I set myself out to work on my writing project, but even so, I’m not giving up on the overall goal of making any progress on this beloved work of mine before the end of the year.With that said, I have reorganized my schedule to have a few hours dedicated to writing on Wednesdays! I feel like having a few hours in a day of the week is a better way for me to focus. Since my hobbies are pretty varied, focusing on too many things every day seems like an easy way to get overwhelmed and burned out in the end. Anyways! Here’s hoping for better writing sessions in my future."

    "content": "I’ve been having trouble writing fiction as of late. I have this original work that I have been mulling over for a while now and really like to get the first chapter out this year, but all I managed to write was some of the worldbuilding, CVs, and some notes.One problem I have is focusing more on it. While writing is not hard in itself, brainstorming is, and just waiting for inspiration to strike me won’t cut it anymore. I want to make real progress, and one thing that writing these posts taught me is that just the action of getting the words on the screen can help get those creative juices flowing.So hence the challenge! I’m going to try to get at least a solid half an hour of writing every day for the next week, starting this Sunday.The goal here is to get all or most of the brainstorming done; any progress on the first chapter draft is just a bonus, and hopefully, this could be a good start to making it a habit.Thirty minutes is not a daunting goal and isn’t insignificant either. I think it strikes a good balance for an intermediate writer like myself. I also like that it is a time goal and not a word count goal. From my experience, word count-based goals can be intimidating when starting and demotivating when you fail. It can also incentivize padding things out just to meet a threshold, and for this challenge, I want to mostly focus on ideas, so a word count is insufficient and ill-suited.But yeah, with that said, I will be taking reflection notes after each session, and once the week is over, I will compile them into one and do a final review. This will give me a rough idea of what I can improve upon.I will, of course, be posting the final review here when all is settled.As always, thanks for reading! If you’re a fellow writer as well, I would love to know what tips and tricks you use to keep yourself motivated!"

    "content": "The Great Holo Holding a Potato.I’m not much of a seasonal anime watcher, but this last season is an exception! With the return of the fantastic Spice and Wolf! And now that the first half has finished airing, I’d like to share my thoughts on it!Now I have only seen the first Spice and Wolf anime, several times, I might add! So keep that in mind. I’m sure the light novels are fantastic, and I will surely read them one day! But for now, I will only be comparing it to the original anime.The series is aptly subtitled Merchant Meets the Wise Wolf.It really encapsulates that this is the beginning of their story, and I expect that the next season will have its own distinct subtitle hinting at the events to be unfolded.The anime itself is unique; not many anime that I know of tackle the subject of economics, and Spice and Wolf really delivers on this front! It makes economics interesting and fun.Besides the fun world of trade and myths, The characters are also fun, sassy, and memorable. You have the great Holo as the main protagonist!She’s witty, snarky, and, of course, wise, and she contrasts well with our other protagonist, Kraft Lawrence, a traveling merchant knowledgeable in his trade but still kind to others and not just looking to fatten his pockets.They make a great pair, and their growing romance isn’t forced or stilted; they just genuinely care for each other, which is refreshing to see!I’m watching the dub as I usually do when available, and I’m happy to report that the voice actors from the first series have returned to reprise their roles! I haven’t checked the credits to be sure, but if there are any replacements, then they are really good replacements!Overall, I’m halfway through this twenty-five-episode romp, and I’m enjoying it immensely! I really hope we get a continuation; looking at its popularity, it’s pretty likely. I can’t wait to see the rest of their story!"

    "content": "Recently, I’ve been dealing with transferring large files, and while there are plenty of tools available to do the job, most of them are slow, have a size limit, or are cumbersome to set up. Luckily, I learned about a powerful and simple-to-use tool called croc while looking for alternatives, and it’s exactly what I’ve been looking for in a file transfer tool!Fast, easy to use, and secure! It’s so good that it’s odd I haven’t seen it mentioned much. So, to remedy that, let me tell you all about it!croc is a CLI(Command-line Interface) cross-platform file transfer tool. Now, I know for some, the CLI may seem daunting, and you may scoff at the idea of it being simple, but it really is!croc commands are simple to grasp and straightforward. If you have just a tiny bit of experience in the CLI, you’ll be fine. For those who don’t, I’ll try my best to make it as easy as possible.First, let’s install croc. It’s available on most popular Linux distributions and, of course, on BSDs, Mac, and Windows, but I’ll be focusing on Linux for this guide.I’m using Debian, and croc is available from the official repo, so all we have to do is:sudo apt updatesudo apt install croc -yNow, on the receiving device, an Android tablet, I’m using Termux, and “croc” is available on the base repo as well, so again, it’s super easy to install!pkg updatepkg upgradepkg install croc -yBe sure to install any updates if available before installing “croc”. This is Linux CLI 101! If you’re wondering why there’s “-y” after the command, it’s just so “apt” knows that we confirmed the install; otherwise, you’ll get a prompt after executing the command.Now that we have “croc” installed, let’s start by sending a file. For example, I have this huge archive file filled with downloaded YouTube video files that I’d like to have on my tablet for later viewing. Luckily, “croc” can handle large files just fine. Since it’s a direct connection between devices, it’s fast and has no limits on file size other than your own storage limitations.croc send youtube-videos.zipcroc will then do its preparations and leave you with a code like this:Code is: 4812-airline-lima-scriptOn your receiving device type croc and initiate it. You will get a prompt asking for your code.Enter receive code:Now, just enter your code, and “croc” will do the rest! It’s pretty zen-like just seeing it go.Once it’s done, your file or files should be happily sitting in the directory where you initiated the croc command. So, what do you think? Not that hard, right? And you didn’t have to deal with slow cloud storage services or emailing yourself a file…But now you know better! And that’s what counts at the end of the day."

    "content": "I recently read a post1 by Kev Quirk2, about his computing history, and it seemed like a fun topic, so I’m going to put my own twist on it!I’ve been into computing for two decades now—yes, I’m old. (◔‿◔)In that time, I have gone through four computers; one laptop and three desktops, experimenting with several operating systems and applications!1999 - 2004 Compaq Presario 7400 SeriesNot my exact model or picture, but is the closest to the one we had back then!My first PC, or should I say our first family computer, was a Compaq Presario 7400 series desktop tower. I’m not sure of the precise model, but I remember it had a Pentium 3 CPU, 64 MB of RAM, a 30GB HDD, and ran on Windows 98. It even came with an upgrade CD to Windows 98 SE!I have fond memories of playing games, going online for the first time, and slowly learning more about computers during that period. I remember reading both the accompanying manuals quite frequently; it was the closest thing to scratching the itch when the computer was occupied by my father or sister.It eventually became my own computer when my dad upgraded to a new custom-built PC and my sister bought herself a laptop. Even though it was a hand-me-down, I was quite happy to have a PC all to myself!Although I don’t use Windows anymore, Windows 98 will always have a special spot in my heart!2004 - 2009 Custom Built Pentium 4 DesktopAround the time I was in middle school, my dad surprised me with a custom-built PC! I don’t know much about its components, but it had a Pentium 4 CPU, 1GB of RAM, 300GB HDD, internal graphics, and a copy of Windows XP. It was a good machine and it worked terrifically well!Windows XP was also more stable than Windows 98, so it made for a pleasant experience. However, unlike 98, I hold no love for XP; Sorry XP Fans!This was also the time when I became more interested in Linux! I had read about it before and was intrigued, but this is when I learned more about it and started ordering those free Live CDs! Fun times.2009 - 2014 HP Pavilion Slimline s5600 SeriesThe Pavilion Slimline Case still holds up in my opinion!When I enrolled in university for my major in Computer Science, I needed a new machine because my old one was left at my dad’s when we moved, and it was time for an upgrade!I was advised to get a laptop, which in hindsight was probably the best choice. However, I was stubborn and preferred the repairability and power of a desktop since I rarely needed to leave my desk. So, I received an HP Pavilion Slimline desktop as a gift from my mom. Its slim case was perfect for my desk space, and it looked great too! It featured a Pentium Duo CPU, my first dual-core CPU, 4GB of RAM, a 500GB HDD, Intel HD internal graphics, and a copy of Windows 7 Home Premium.This machine was fantastic! It ran smoothly without any issues and was quite impressive for an entry-level rig at that time!Windows 7 was also pleasant to use. Even though I was already using Linux and enjoying it, I decided to stick with Windows 7 on this machine. I eventually installed Kubuntu, and it ran fantastically!2014 - 2018 The Dark EraDuring late 2014 I moved over to Florida and with it I parted away with a lot of my stuff including my trusty HP, I didn’t want to lug it all the way and it was already bit out of date anyways.This was what I called my dark era of computing since I effectively didn’t have a computer until late 2018 making do with tablets and later a smartphone. Not the best of times for me personally either, it was a dark era indeed.2018 - Current ASUS C101PA 3in1 ChromebookMy current computer and my first Notebook PC!By this time, I had gotten my first job at a Mexican restaurant and could afford to buy my own computer! After saving up all the earnings I could from tip-wage work, I was able to purchase a not very glamorous but good enough for me Chromebook!It was the best for the price and very portable, something that I warmed up to as I grew up. All I needed was a device that allowed me to study, take notes, take tests, do some light coding, and light web browsing, and this small ASUS delivered that in spades!It’s also a convertible, which makes it extra handy when laying on the bed or setting it up in tent mode, for example, in the kitchen!It packs a Hexacore Rockchip CPU, 4GB of RAM, 16GB eMMC, and runs Chrome OS. I know those are underwhelming specs, but it works for me.I have been feeling its age now that it’s doesn’t get any more updates (Auto-Update Expiry), and I tend to push its limits sometimes by running Linux apps on top of a container called Crostini, but it still has plenty of life in it.I will replace it as my main device soon. Once I have an apartment, I’m planning on either building my own or getting one of these small but powerful mini PCs!What about you?Regardless, I’m interested in your computing history as well! Did you have a “dark” era like me? What operating systems have you used? Are you more of a laptop or desktop person? Let me know via email!

    "content": "  Addendum 2024-07-18  Quick update! I recently discovered another system by the name of Habits.txt. This tool is created by fellow GitHub user @estebanthi and is much more comprehensive and just better than the system I hastily put together. There’s no need for a bash script, and he even developed a nice CLI tool as well! I highly recommend using his system instead if you’re looking for a plain-text alternative for tracking habits. It’s what I personally use now and absolutely love it!  Initially, I shared my system because I couldn’t find any plain-text alternatives at that time. This post was written in early to mid-May, and back then, I hadn’t come across any other plain-text systems based on todo.txt for habit tracking. It seems that around mid-May, estebanthi released his habits.txt version, so I must have missed it!  Although our systems are different, I regret not noticing his sooner! Please disregard this post and give estebanthi’s habits.txt a try immediately! I believe it’s exactly what you’re looking for!  If, by any chance, you are reading this estebanthi. Thank you so much for creating such an indispensable tool! It’s quite remarkable that we both had similar ideas around the same time. Life works in mysterious ways.  I will keep this post as it is, as it is part of my blog’s history and If anyone comes across this post, I can gently guide them in the right direction!I’ve been using todo.txt 1; a special syntax for structuring tasks in a plain text file for a while, and so far I’ve really been digging its simplicity! I follow the file-over-app philosophy as best as I can, and having my to-dos in a simple .txt file is another way I don’t depend on an unnecessary app, in my opinion.While Todo.txt is great at what it sets out to do, I can’t help but wonder what else it is capable of? This came into practice when I started tracking my habits a few months back. I tried multiple methods: pen and paper, a habit tracker app, a table in a markdown file. But none of them felt right. That is until I experimented with tracking them on my todo.txt file, and it worked surprisingly well!Todo.txt has everything you need for tracking tasks. But its syntax is quite expansive and easy to grasp. So, I made my own habit tracking system using its specifications, and I call it Habits.txt!Just like Todo.txt, you can and are recommended to have a done.txt or todo.archive.txt file where your completed tasks get archived. If anything, this is a must-have for Habits.txt as this is the way you can keep track of your progress. So let’s get started by creating both files in your preferred directory like this:touch habits.txt habits.archive.txtYou can use done.txt instead of habits.archive.txt if you prefer, but personally, since I have my todo.txt and habits.txt files in the same directory, I like having that distinction.Now let’s add our first habit! Using your favorite editor, write your habit on the first line like this:Read for 30 minutesWe follow up by adding a project tag just like in todo.txt!Read for 30 minutes +leisureAs you can see now, our habit is under the +leisure project tag. This way we can keep our habits organized, but we won’t stop there! We’ll add a tag to track when we will do our habit.(D) Read for 30 minutes +leisureJust like todo.txt priority tags, except instead of priority, we are using it to keep track of when a habit will take place. (D) here stands for daily, but you can use (W) and (M) for weekly and monthly respectively.Optionally, you can add a context tag to specify where and in what manner you do a habit like; @home @gym @work, etc.(D) Read for 30 minutes +leisure @homeNow that we have our habit nicely logged, how do we mark it? The same way as todo.txt, we place an x at the beginning of each habit and add the date when we had completed it.x 2024-05-25 (D) Read for 30 minutes +leisureBeautiful! We now have a completed habit entry. Now we can move it over to our previously created habits.archive.txt. All done!You now know how to log habits with habits.txt! Pretty simple, right? But that’s just the basics. Here’s how I automated it to make it easier.I created a simple bash script that routinely wipes my habits.txt file in the early morning and adds my currently working on habits to the file. Here’s a template so you can make your own!#!/bin/bash# Clear the contents of the file&gt; / # Location of your habits.txt file# Add text to the fileecho \"Your habits here!\" &gt;&gt; / # Location of your habits.txt fileThen I set a cron job to run this script in the early mornings, and voila! Now all I have to do is mark my habits as I complete them and then archive them. You can use any editor that supports the todo.txt syntax like VS Code with its fantastic todo.txt extension or Markor on mobile!Use any syncing platform or cloud providers to sync between your devices. I use Git and GitHub to keep it in sync, just like I do with my notes. This is just scratching the surface of what you can do with it, as plain text is extremely extensible! So why not give it a shot, and if you do, please let me know how it went! (•‿•)Footnotes            Todo.txt The most simple and extensible way to track tasks! &#8617;&#xfe0e;      "

    "content": "Back with another post, and this time about a game, if you can believe it! My recent posts don’t really scream gamer, so let’s change that! Let’s talk about one of my favorite game series, or I guess you could say it used to be one of them.Truth be told, the recent Pokémon games haven’t been clicking with me. There are several reasons why, which I will go into detail about soon, but for now, a little backstory on me and the series.Pokémania was in full bloom back in the 90s, and there wasn’t a shortage of people to trade, battle, or just talk about Pokémon! I’ve never had many friends as a kid, and neither do I have now, but that’s besides the point!The ones I did have, we’re all thanks to Pokémon! It allowed me to connect to people over trades, battles, or just over our shared love of the games, anime, TCG, or any other facets of the franchise. Something that as an introverted autistic kid was hard to do.I’m sure I’m not alone in this. It may be corny, but I’m going to say it anyway! Pokémon made me the person I am today, and even though I dislike some aspects of it. I can always count on the games to be fantastic! Or at least that was the case.Recently, ever since the release of Pokémon Let’s Go, the games feel like they’re in a mid-life crisis, losing sight of themselves and becoming more experimental. While that’s not necessarily a bad thing, it’s good to break the stale formula once in awhile. I feel like they are experimenting with the wrong elements.Art and style are really important to me, and I absolutely love Ken Sugimori’s style! It screams Pokémon to me and is symbolic to the series, or at least I think so. But it looks like that’s not the case over at GameFreak, the game company that develops the main-series Pokémon games. Let’s Go went with a different non-cell-shaded style for its graphics. Something that has been a mainstay ever since the release of X and Y in 2013.Which is weird because they themselves said they decided on cell-shaded graphics as a way to preserve Ken Sugimori’s style going forward.Now, that would be fine and dandy if it were just those games, but no, they kept experimenting with the style of the games with the next entry, Sword and Shield. This time there isn’t much whiplash from Sun and Moon to Let’s Go, but something about it feels off, and that’s because it merges with some style elements from Let’s Go. a compromise, if you will.Now I have no idea what’s going on inside of GameFreak, but looking from the outside in, it feels like there’s some disagreements on the game’s graphics within the teams, and so it looks like they’re compromising. Something unheard of since the main-series games kept a consistent style for the graphics before that point.So maybe this will be the style moving forward? Or so I thought! Legends: Arceus releases, and look at this. A new art style! This time much more consistent with the older games, but with a twist of its own! Using watercolors.Honestly, I love this style! It is cell-shaded and adds its own unique look; this is what Pokémon games should look like, in my opinion! Unfortunately, my hopes for future entries graphics were crushed utterly by the release of Scarlet and Violet.Now I’m not going to open that can of worms today. This post is already longer than I expected.No, I’m only talking about the game’s graphics style and in my opinion, what a huge downgrade it is. Just like Let’s Go is not cell-shaded, and worse, is just uglier?! It feels soulless, not to mention that they added realistic textures to people and Pokémon. Now, this is a matter of taste, but for a fantasy game, I don’t think making it look realistic is the right call. Games are a form of escapism into other worlds from our own, which is emphasized by making them colorful and different.I can stop asking myself, Why would GameFreak do this? They took so much care to preserve Ken’s Sugimori style that they even pushed back on going 3D earlier due to it.Maybe it is just that GameFreak has changed? Maybe they have a new vision now? And with new hands taking over some of the veteran staff, maybe that’s just the natural progression?I can’t say, but I will say one thing: this is not the future I want. For me, Ken Sugimori’s style is fundamental for the series. I can’t look at anything else not resembling it and say, “That’s Pokémon!”. Not without a heavy heart, at least. Maybe I just don’t like change? But one thing is for sure: I won’t be playing these entries. I can’t stomach it, and that may sound silly, but that’s how important it is for me.But this isn’t the end as much as I would like it to be!We have a new entry in the series with Legends: Z-A, and it looks promising. We don’t have much information or gameplay, for that matter, but fans are excited for it!I, on the other hand, look at this with apprehension. I want nothing more than to be hyped for it like I was with Legends: Arceus, but I can’t help but keep my hopes low. I just don’t want to be disappointed again. So all I can do is hope that this time will be different, but that’s all I can do. At least until we get some gameplay, but for now, I’m taking a break from this series. I hope it’s just a short break and nothing more.Phew! That was a long one! If you read this far, thank you! I appreciate all of my readers. What about you? Do you like how the Pokémon games are heading? Do you feel similar to me? Let me know via email! (•‿•)"

    "content": "Since I now take notes and write posts on my tablet and Chromebook. Actually, the last few posts I have written are from my tablet using Markor!What can I say? I like laying on my bed and getting some posts out, a lifesaver when I was sick last month and didn’t want to leave my bed for extended periods.Now, working from my tablet for posts is easy enough. I just gh repo clone my blog repo to it using Termux, I could use some IDEs with Git support, but I found all of them lacking. I want something as close to VSCode as possible. The closest was Acode but it lacks features that I’m used to, if only VSCode was available for android and no the VSCode PWA is nice and all, but I’d prefer a native app for speed and for better file access.So I’m sticking with Git on Termux, although that means I have to add files to my local repo and then push them to my remote repo, instead of working with the remote repo directly like VSCode.This gave me an idea though! An idea that somehow I never thought about before. Why don’t I use Git and GitHub to sync my notes?After all, my blog repo houses .md files, the same files I use for my notes. Why don’t I do the same?Now before we delve on that, let me tell you how I synced my notes and all my files before.Like I said before, I used to have a small homelab setup in which I had a Samba server, so in this case I didn’t sync my files at all and just had a centralized place for them. This was the best thing I had ever done in terms of file management. No need to worry about syncing conflicts and losing data over it, which happened more than once for me, RIP.After my home lab suffered an early death due to a bad power supply which, by the way, you can read about here!It was back to good old syncing for me. This time I just manually synced some files. I keep everything on a flash drive connected to my Chromebook and some files like my movies, shows and books on my tablet, since that’s where I consume most of those media.That was a pain, as you can imagine to managed! So I decide to try out Syncthing! I used similar software before with mixed results, but I never tried out anything and, for the most part, it worked well. This time I synched my notes as well, since I have started experimenting with taking notes on my tablet like I have aforementioned.And well, it didn’t last long, at all! After a few days, my Chromebook crashed from running the Synthing server, which is odd since it shouldn’t be that intensive but crostini, where I was running it, can be quite resource intensive. So that was a wash and a huge bummer since I love having my notes automatically synched specifically.This brings us to now, and I know I have digressed a fair bit! But I wanted to let you know about my situation before showing you this solution.Like anything, this is just one solution to a problem, and it may not be the best solution for you! But in sharing it, you may make your own or modify it to work for you.Regardless, setting it up is quite straightforward, but you will need to familiarize yourself with Git beforehand if you aren’t already, so please check the About Git page beforehand, it will tell you all you need to know to get started, although you can also follow this guide, but I highly recommend reading the About Git page first.First make sure you have a GitHub account or make one. Once you have one in a terminal, install both git and gh. You don’t need gh necessarily, but it makes the process easier if you’re using GitHub.Now use gh auth login, follow the instructions to authenticate, make sure that you select to authenticate Git as well. This is the main reason we are using gh.Once that’s done, running gh repo create, you can either create a new remote repo or use a local repo you have initialized. For me, the last option didn’t work, so I just made a new remote repo.Okay, now I will go through the repo creation process. I have selected to make it a private repo. You can, however, do anything you want. Do note that making it private doesn’t necessarily mean it is, so please don’t add any sensitive files as a precaution. I marked it as private, so it doesn’t show up on my profile.For reference, I named my repo Notes. I selected to not have a license or .gitignore and I decided not to have a readme either.Then make sure to clone that repo locally. You can do this when creating a repo. It will prompt you.Now just add your files to the repo folder on your device or if you use your local repo with your notes inside, then you’re done! Your notes are synched on GitHub now, and you can access them with any Git client or an IDE with Git support like VSCode, or you can just clone the repo on the other device you want to keep it synced with.For us, though, we must continue! Once you add your files, it is time to use git add. which will add all the file changes to that repo. Then we use git commit -m \"Your commit message here! to commit our changes. Then it is just a git push and you’re done!Our notes are synced! Now we can work on our notes on one device and then follow the above instructions if you’re not using a Git client or IDE/Editor that has Git integration to keep it synced.While this isn’t automatic, you can use an IDE like VSCode to seamlessly work with your notes or make a script that does it for you! It beats manually using SFTP to sync my notes, that’s for sure!"

    "content": "Before we get started, I just realized that this year is a leap year! Making this a leap post! Just found that tidbit cool and fitting for our topic today!I haven’t updated you all about my website in a while, last time was when I had transition into Cloudflare Pages and moved into a newer version of Jekyll and the minima theme gem.This time I want to share some plans I have for the future of my website and what that means for you!First off, while minima theme has served me well I have grown to see that it doesn’t fit what I want for a theme.minima is very simple and minimalistic by design which is the reason I picked it but there’s a few features that I would really like missing, for example:      There’s no option to add a logo, you can however tinker around with CSS and HTML and add it that way but is not a simple or a easy solution.        There’s not a natively built-in search function, which for what I want to transform this website into needs.        No native support for header images, while not a necessity is a nice to have feature.  While I love the simplicity of the theme, it is just too simple for me. I want minimalism. But I do want to be able to express myself as well!This bring us to minimal-mistakes! A minimal theme but with way more features built-in than minima. It has everything I ever want or need!A search function, built-in logo support, header images, and not to mention a way more fitting theme for a digital garden!Plus it is well documented unlike minima, so a web dev newbie like me can get behind it!But I bet your thinking; “That’s all well and good but what’s this about a digital garden?”.So for those of you uninformed I’ll be glad to filled you in!A digital garden is much like any other website but focused on creating and fostering ideas or I guess you could say planting and nurturing ideas!It focuses on linking ideas together and curation  unlike a blog where old posts fall to the wayside for newer posts, posts can be evergreen and be updated with new links and info over time.Instead of scrolling a feed you’ll land on a homepage of feature articles, posts or notes curated by the writer and when you click one you’ll noticed that they bidirectionally linked, a post can lead other posts like and endless rabbit hole of ideas.Another boon of a digital garden is that is not just a blog your not limited in what you want to curated and showcase in this space!For example you can have a list of games you have played, your favorites, what are you currently playing and more! You can engage with your audience in more ways than one.In a nutshell a digital garden is personal space online that you make your own with whatever interests you!So what does that mean for this website? Well, nothing much will change since even before I knew about this concept I wanted to make more than just a blog and create a place of the Internet for myself.A portal to my world as it were, In fact that’s what the name comes from! My very own dimension online but it also serves a double meaning, I wanted this dimension to be a place of learning as well this is why about half of my posts are guides or tutorials.And that fits perfectly with digital gardens since they place a huge deal on public learning. So if anything I will just add more content and deeper insight into my interests.I’ll still have a page with chronologically sorted posts for those who want to read the latest and for feed readers. But I will slowly put more emphasis on curation and if your looking for something in particular you can always search for it!I also want to add a microblog to this digital garden as well! I just recently left cohost! Because I barely used it, and it looks too much like social media that I grew to despise nowadays. But with it, I lose out on its microblogging aspects, so I’m making my own!The plan is to write my thoughts daily that later can become full on posts or articles! Making the writing process much easier.“So when will we expect these changes?” You might ask? Well not anytime soon, I haven’t even began tinkering with minimal-mistakes yet! Is going to take a while why I finished customizing the theme and making sure is well polished. But you can expect it this year at least.This will be a big leap for this website and is next real evolution and I hope you are excited as much as I am for it! For now though expect a new post mid March!"

    "content": "I am bringing you a short post for this month since I have been enjoying my holidays, and my last post was my longest and most worked on yet! So I’m taking a small break for now, but I don’t want to leave you with nothing for this month, so here we are. I hope you enjoy it!I daily drive a Chromebook, and that device has just recently reached EOL (End of Life) or AUE (Auto-Update Expiry), as Google calls it, but is practically the same thing. I’m hugely opposed to planned obsolescence, so I’m not just going to get a new Chromebook and chuck my old one out.That’s just e-waste, in my opinion, and even though I love ChromeOS as an operating system, this will be my last Chromebook. I can’t, in good conscience, keep using products that endorse this behavior. Now I know there’s a Framework Chromebook, and support has been increased to ten years, but that’s still not enough for me. What if my device is perfectly capable by then? I should, as a consumer, choose how long I use a product, not the company.I thought this wouldn’t be a big deal when I learned about lacros, a project that aims to split the Chrome browser from ChromeOS, meaning that it can get updated even after AUE (supposedly). The problem is that Google decided in their infinite wisdom to tie lacros to ChromeOS updates, meaning that as soon as the device is AUE, lacros will only update a few versions away from the last ChromeOSupdate.eMaking it completely useless for the purpose of extending the life of the device, at first I thought it was just the behavior of being an experimental flag, but it seems Google never designed it for that purpose in the first place, which makes sense: Why not just extend the updates indefinitely then? It wouldn’t align with their best interests, I guess.Luckily, there are alternate ways to keep your Chromebook or Chrome device up-to-date! First off, there’s ChromeOS Flex, formerly Cloudready, an official distro of ChromeOS without Android, but that’s for the best, in my opinion. This version doesn’t have an AUE date (yet!) and is meant to be a light operating system to bring new life to old x86 devices, but it can also be used on Chromebooks! As long as you have an x86 Chromebook, there is no support for ARM just yet. If you can manage it, this is the best option, as it requires little setup other than installing a regular BIOS with the Mr. Chromebox script.There’s also brunch! Which is quite similar to Flex but is a community project and supports Android apps on some devices. This thus requires a lot of setup and is only available for x86 devices, which mine aren’t, so this and Flex are a no-go for me.Then we have the good old, reliable Crouton! While not in active development, it still works wonders, allowing you to run a full desktop environment and apps. Chrouton works on all Chrome devices, but due to running inside ChromeOS within a chroot, you still need to access the shell to install it.Finally, we have the topic of this very post, Chromebrew! Unlike the others, Chromebrew is a package manager for ChromeOS, making it a full-on Linux distro! So if you enjoy ChromeOS and would like a proper package manager like I do, this is for you! But other than the niftyness of having Linux apps run on bare metal, there’s a second benefit we are looking for!With Chromebrew, we can install the latest version of Chrome, and its performance is better than lacros in my opinion! Allowing us to have an updated browser on our AUE Chromebook plus other handy apps. To get started, we first need to set up developer mode on our Chromebook, which is an easy process of holding CTRL+ESC and the power button when turning on the device.Go through the prompt to disable verification, and voila! The device will start in developer mode after it resets itself, or powerwashes, as Google calls it. Then it’s just a matter of logging in, opening up chrosh, typing and entering shell, and using the Chromebrew script.Once it’s installed, you’ll need to get used to its commands. Here are a few ways to get started.      crew is the base command when calling upon Chromebrew. You need this command anytime you want to do something with Chromebrew.        install is self-explanatory; you use it to install a package and dependencies. -‘remove’, just like the last one, is a no-brainer and allows you to remove a package and its dependencies.        update This one doesn’t work like you expect; instead of updating repos, there aren’t any here; it’s all in a git repo. It updates Chromebrew itself.        upgrade works as intended, allowing you to upgrade specific or all packages. - build If a package isn’t available, you can build it from source with this command. I may need to do this myself for some apps like Tailscale.        list lists all the packages locally or available to install.        search Finally, there’s a search command to find packages with, which is quite handy!  Remember to use the commands in conjunction with each other, not alone, so if you want to install Chrome, for example, you use crew install chrome.In conclusion, Chromebrew is a great tool! Regardless of using it to give new life to older hardware, I feel like every Chromebook or Chrome device owner should have this in their toolkit to make ChromeOS even more enjoyable to use!"

    "content": "Before We BeginEmblem Marth.This has been quite a year in the gaming sphere! is hard not to be overwhelm by the sheer volume of quality titles out this year and with every year us gamers decided on just one game to be our game of the year!This year has been awfully packed making the choice even harder but one game reigned supreme regardless of that: Fire Emblem Engage!Ever since the game released last January and I got my hands on it that fateful midnight, I knew deep down in my heart that this game will be my game of the year and I wasn’t wrong!Now that I have sinked in more three-hundred or so hours into it and completed most of the supports, I wanted to complete them before writing this but supports in Engage are notorisly hard to unlock!So now feeling well-versed on it,I feel is the perfect time to talk about my favorite game of the year!The (Not) Anticipated ReleaseA Bad End?Back last year, in June, we got the first mention of a new Fire Emblem game, which happened to be Engage! According to a leak from a Reddit user, screenshots from an earlier build of the game surfaced, and the overall community reaction was mixed.Most of them thought it was fake, including me! When I first saw the screenshots, I disregarded them as being from a Chinese FE-like mobile game and went about my day. I didn’t give it much thought otherwise. Back then, for me, it clearly looked fake, but I was so wrong!Then, late that year, we got our first official announcement along with a trailer in a direct. There were no doubts about it; Fire Emblem Engage was real! Now, before this point, I was still skeptical of the authenticity of the leak, like most people. I don’t particularly care for leaks in this day and age when video game companies leak and spoil their audience by themselves.But nonetheless, some of the community was worried about this leak, and rightfully so! Since it was in a wildly different direction than that last game, Three Houses, the artwork was one of the points that intrigued me, with its vivid colors and quite out there designs. We haven’t seen a FE quite like this!But since I have disregarded the leak, I wasn’t worried or against any of these changes; I’ll see it when I see it, and did I ever see it? The announcement of Fire Emblem Engage for me was a bit shocking, but not unwelcome! I was so sure it was a fake that I never gave it the slightest chance of being real! But after watching the trailer again, I couldn’t stop myself from liking what I was seeing!The visuals look striking! So colorful and vibrant, it is fair to say we have never seen a Fire Emblem game like this before! The animated cutscenes look great! They are so clean, and they may just be the best-looking cutscenes in all of Fire Emblem! The little gameplay we saw looks great; it seems to run much faster than Three Houses, and the battle animations look fantastic!All in all, I really like the trailer, and in my opinion, it was 180 to my first impression from the leak. I was actually fairly excited for it! The community was trying to warm up to it as well; not everyone liked what they saw, but it was turning out to be more positive overall.Some started bashing the game before it even got released, saying it was “too different and too anime!” The first one has merit; it is quite a departure, but I can’t fathom the second. Are we to believe Fire Emblem wasn’t ever anime?! Is one thing to not like the artwork, the other is being ignorant. But regardless, people seem to be warming up to it, and genuine anticipation was garnered as well, but just like with any Fire Emblem release, there were always haters! Although these seem to be more vocal this time around, regardless, in a few months the game will be released, and we will soon know what it entails!Engaging GameplayBattle Overview.I guess I’ll start with the first thing I noticed while playing Engage, and that is refreshing and engaging gameplay! (Sorry, not sorry!)After playing Three Houses, Engage is quite refreshing in how it gets right to the point. Houses has quite a lot of things to unpack before you hit your first battle, saving the students from bandits, but in Engage, you get your first taste of battle right after a short cutscene in premonition.Giving you time to get acclimated to the new combat and engagement system! The first thing you’ll notice right away is that you don’t have a cursor or arrow showing you where you can move around your unit; instead, selecting a unit shows the moving area, and the unit automatically moves alongside your cursor.This is called Direct in the game settings and will take some getting used to, but not to fret! You could always set it back to cursor and return to the traditional cursor and arrow, but I wouldn’t disregard it right away once you get used to it. It is quite an efficient and smoother experience.Next, you’ll notice the Emblem Rings. Marth has a list of passive and active skills you get access to thanks to Emblem Sync, allowing your unit to have these skills as long as they’re wearing an Emblem Ring. They can acquire some of them by inheriting them, but we’ll talk about this when we get there.For example, Marth’s skill Perceptive, when activated, gives your unit Avoid +15 per fight. Some skills offer passive boosts that are activated as long as your unit wears the ring. But they all applied some kind of buff or ability, like Corrin’s Dragon Vein, allowing your unit, depending on type, to use certain terrain effects. Some skills have additional effects when used on different types of units, like Sigurd’s Gallop. If a calvary-type unit initiates this skill, they will get two more additional movements while engaged.Now to the more interesting part, Engages! You can engage with an Emblem Ring as long as it is the first time per battle or after it has recovered energy. You can do this by waiting on an energy spot on the map or continuing fighting with that unit until the recovery bar is full.Engaging provides huge buffs and boosts, but only for three turns! So you have to balance your strategy around them; when or where to use them is something you need to figure out as you play, but you’ll have plenty of time to master these mechanics!Now, while engaged, your unit gets access to Engage Skills, a more powerful version of the regular skills like Sigurd’s Gallop or Marth’s Divine Speed, allowing your unit to use an additional attack dealing 50% damage!It is important to manage these skills for the best effect, but more importantly, engaging gives your unit access to new and stronger weapons regardless of their unit type or weapon proficiency. There is an even more important buff that engaging provides: Engage Attacks! These powerful attacks can only be used once per engage and can be outright devastating! They can turn the tide of battle and ensure victory for your unit.Lodestar Rush is the first one you’ll be able to use, normally a 7-hit attack with 30% damage per hit, and using the main character,  Alear, you’ll get a bonus of 2 attacks thanks to their Dragon typing.Engage attacks aren’t strictly offensive; there’s Micaiah’s Great Sacrifice, a healing move that heals the whole party at the cost of the unit casting it losing 99% of their HP, unless they’re a dragon-type unit only losing 30%. There’s also Ike’s Great Aether! Like the name implies, this is a defensive move targeting your unit, and once unleashed, it does massive damage to the foes around them and heals your unit afterwards.Just like mastering Engage Skills, mastering Engage Attacks will take time but will be worth it later on in the game and on harder difficulties!Now that we have the Engage basics patted down, there are more intricacies as well as new mechanics introduced in Engage that we will need to understand the gameplay. Like unit types! Understanding unit types is crucial for strategizing and maximizing effectiveness in battles.Now, that doesn’t sound too different to any experienced Fire Emblem player, but I’m not talking about unit classes, but their typing! In Engage, units are categorized into different typings as well as their class. For example, Alear starts off with the Dragon Child class, but they are also classified as a dragon!In Battle!Now there are six types all together: Dragon, Calvary, Backup, Mystical, Qi Adept, and Covert! These have all their unique abilities offered by their typing; for example, Dragon-type units have additional effects while engaged with Emblems, Calvary has more movement, and Backup can do chain attacks if they are aligned with the adjacent unit initiating an attack.But more importantly, each has different additional effects when engaged with Emblem Rings! Like we saw with Marth’s Lodestar Rush on units like Alear! And just like classes, you can change your unit into a new unit type as well! Want more backup units so you can use more chain attacks? Go for it! These systems increased the amount of customization for your units.Reclassing, like I mentioned before, is back! Engage goes back to more of a traditional classing system; instead of deciding what classes to be certified into, like in Houses, Engage units have their starting/canonical classes and have the option to move into any non-special classes! Yep, I said any class, unlike Awakening or Fates, when you have a variety of classes you can choose from. Engage, on the other hand, opens up the floodgates as they were, allowing you to make some wacky builds if you like!Unlike Houses, Engage uses a traditional two-tier classing system, so you have your base classes and advanced classes, and like the games before Houses, units reset to level one when they change classes. It is recommended that you promote your units ASAP! The exception is Ivy, Hortensia, Timmera, and Fogado, as they can wait as they are in high tens when you recruit them.What else? Oh yeah, of course! Can’t forget about the new mechanics in Engage: The Break and Smash mechanic!These new mechanics are, to me, the heart of Engage’s captivating gameplay! To start, the weapon triangle is back along with a new triangle consisting of arts, knives, and tomes. The break mechanic adds on top of that when you or your enemy, (Yeah you heard right, it can be both ways! ) attack with an effective weapon type like a lance versus a sword; not only do you get bonus damage, but you also break them, which means they can’t attack for the following two turns!This is so simple, but it adds so much needed depth to the combat! Now you are actively penalized for turtling, a technique used when you wait for the enemy to come to you and let your units counterattack them to finish them off. You now have to be proactive in avoiding being broken, or else you may be ambushed without recourse.Like I said, a simple change, but a great one! I hope that the next entry keeps this mechanic; it feels just as universal as the weapon triangle!So what about the Smash mechanic? Well, while not as impactful as the break mechanic, it adds an additional flair if you’re willing to use it! Unlike his sibling, Smash is quite optional, though you have to worry about enemies doing this, which is not very common. Smash breaks your unit and moves them one space back. Now it doesn’t seem useful at first, but if you use it right, you can give your units more openness to attack or have a weaker unit attack and gain experience since they’re also broken and can’t retaliate, making it useful to train low-level units.But if is not your cup of tea, It is completely optional and can only be used with certain special, great, and blade weapons.Overall, these two mechanics add so much to the depth of the gameplay that, along with Emblems Rings, Engage has its own unique charm unlike other titles.But before we wrap up, let’s talk about maps. Just like any Fire Emblem game, the gameplay can be great, but it doesn’t matter much if the maps you’re playing aren’t fun.Maps here seem a bit smaller; for example, movement across the board has been cut down! Starting with four for infantry and five or six for cavalry. It takes a while to get used to it, but after awhile, I actually prefer it overall to the other games; battles feel much more dynamic and faster. Maybe smoother is the word? I’m not sure, but it feels different, but in a good way!Against a Fell Dragon.Now the actual maps vary quite a bit; some are better than others, but overall they are good enough. Some of my favorites are:  Lythos Tutorial with Lumera          I found this one quite fun since you are just starting out, and as soon as Lumera engages, it can get quite difficult if you don’t know what you are doing, which at this point you probably don’t!        Firene Castle          This one, oh this one! I gave it several tries before beating it the first time. Not only do you have the choice of going head-on inside or splitting your forces, but you also have enemies surrounding you from all sides, and if you are not quick enough, consider not getting any treasure as a thief moves from the far left towards the chests. You also get the first taste of the revival stones. Units with these stones have two health bars instead of just one.        Mountain Pass          This map has avalanches occurring regularly on three different paths; you have to carefully avoid them, or your units will get dragged all the way back! However, you have a strong foe ahead with Past Alear! It was a fun but hectic time. There were many close calls, but we managed to defeat them in the end.      In conclusion, the maps are pretty good, with good variety all around; not every map is a winner, and that’s okay; all of them are fun enough to romp through, at least for me!Wrapping up Engage’s gameplay is the funnest time I had playing a Fire Emblem game. There are just so many layers to a fantastic experience like no other. The whole thing feels smooth! It feels like the team spends the most time here than in any other area! To their detriment, maybe? But that’s not relevant, but I will get to it. Since I have much to say on that matter.So yeah, of all the games in the series I’ve played, I have to say that Engage is my favorite when it comes to the gameplay; nothing can top it! Fates comes close with their map design, but while its gameplay is fun, it lacks the intricacies of Engage, which why I say is a close second. If what you care about in a Fire Emblem game is the gameplay, then Engage has you covered and you don’t need to read on, but if thats just a part of it, like it is for me, then the rest of the game has other enjoyable aspects, some of which may be disappointing to others, but if you want to know more, you just have to keep on reading!A Feast for The Eyes and EarsThe Divine Dragon Lumera Appears!Of course, gameplay isn’t the only thing Engage has going for it! The same could be said about its visuals andsound!Firstly, I must say that this is the best-looking Fire Emblem game by a mile! Fan of Mika Pikazo’s artstyle or not, you can’t argue with me that visuals don’t look striking! It is so much cleaner than Three Houses muddy look, and some scenes are right down mesmerizing!I wonder if the reason they allow you to explore the maps after battle is to showcase the beautiful scenery. At times, I feel like I am in an open-world game when exploring because everything looks so detailed! It really invites you to take a break and take it all in.So the visuals overall are clean, smooth, and polished—something you can say about a lot of aspects of the game, but I have no better words for describing them, so please take a look at some screenshots to get a better idea!Mika Pikazo, one from v-tuber design fame, was chosen as the lead artist for this game, and while I wasn’t in love with her art at first sight, I slowly warm up to her designs! Her art is colorful and quite a departure from the series norm, but in a good way! The colors were as said, but the developers called back to Shadow Dragon and The Blade of Light sprites and styles. Is the clever nod seemingly since this is an anniversary game?Now she’s up there with my favorite Fire Emblem artists, like Kozaki and Hidari from Awakeing, Fates, and Echoes, respectively. Her character design is quite striking, and I will be talking more about that when we get there, but in general, her art is a breath of fresh air!The Brodian Prince and Elusian Princess, Diamant and Ivy!But it’s not only the visuals where Engage shines; it also has a great-sounding soundtrack that I’m coming to warm up to and honestly think is up there with my favorite OSTs of the series!The music is filled with a variety of musical styles and new remixes of old favorites! There’s something for everyone on this soundtrack! I mean, everyone, theres a chessy Saturday morning cartoon main theme for those who love those!It’s hard to describe the soundtrack in more detail, so here are just a couple of my favorites! I took the liberty of linking to the tracks so you can listen to them while you read, and I actually did the same while writing this. ♪  Fiery Bonds (English and Japanese)          What can I say? I love this song! It is bittersweet but hopeful, and every time I hear it, it makes me cry. It reminds me of what a good experience I just had with the game, and when any song does that, it is guaranteed to be one of my favorites! This one also has lyrics!        Tear Streaked (Ice)          Now this one is a banger! It shows up in an important part of the game, and this unique sound to it, as well as including a quire, starts slow but really amps up. I listen to this on occasion outside of the game.        Last Engage (Prayer-Incantation)          This is the final boss music, and just by that alone, it deserves to be on the list! It’s surprisingly hopeful and happy for a final boss theme; it’s like a nice, fun romp through the final boss, and having a quire as well as the good old Fire Emblem theme definitely helps!        Mirrored Engage          This is one of the few tracks from the DLC and also a final boss theme, and like always, it slaps hard! It has a unique start with this almost otherworldly feeling. Is this my second favorite of the DLC tracks? Man, all of the Engage tracks slap!        Inconstant One (Frenzy)          Remember when I said Mirrored Engage was my second favorite DLC track? Well, this is my first! It is an unassuming track at first, but it gets really good after awhile; it has a quire and this unique sound! Weirdly, the regular version of Inconstant One doesn’t sound at all like this, but maybe that’s for the better!        Emblem Engage! (Full Version)          Now I leave you with this! This may be a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon, but this is my cheesy Saturday morning cartoon track! I wasn’t crazy about it at first, but I didn’t hate it either. It was nice to have male vocals for a change, and after awhile, I’ve grown to love this song, especially the full version from the DLC. It’s pretty good! I recommend at least giving the full version a try; you may fall in love with it like I did.      That’s just a few of my favorites, or, I will be here all day! But yeah, the soundtrack overall is great! I recommend giving it a listen, even if you are not interested in the game.A Conflicting StoryOne Last Reunion.With Engage going back to basics, we get a more traditional and simple story, unlike that of Three Houses. Some may see this as a downgrade, but overall, I feel that it does the job quite well, and while it fondles here and there, it is still enjoyable enough.Now we all see the same story of evil dragons and good dragons in other Fire Emblem games, but Engage is unique enough to follow the same story bits but do their own thing with them.In my opinion, this is a character-focused story, focusing on Alear’s journey in finding himself and their rightful place in the world, finding family in unlikely places, and making their own destiny! Enjoying a story such as this requires liking the character that it is focused on. In that way, Alear is central for people to enjoy it. Alear must be an enjoyable character for the story to work, and I think they did well for the most part.I would talk more about Alear and their character arc later on, but for now, I feel that to enjoy one means to enjoy both.This doesn’t mean they aren’t problems, because there are! But honestly, I enjoyed it enough—with twists I honestly didn’t see coming!There are parts that I feel were changed late in development, like some animated cutscenes not showing at all in the game but only in the intro cutscene. Things like these make me feel like the game story went through several rewrites. If these are the causes of the story’s problems, who could say? Only developers can tell, and I’m not sure if they will ever admit it or not.But I’m in the minority that enjoys the story; most hate it or find it hilarious to some degree. I will not disprove those that have concerns because they are valid and I can see where they come from, but stories like most of anything you experience can be subjective, so I would recommend playing the game and giving it a shot or at least watching a playthrough so you can form your own opinions.Before I move on, though, I want to add something. Being as Engage release after Three Houses, I feel it gets an unhealthy amount of bashing for not keeping up with the standards of Three Houses. Fire Emblem never was much for having fantastic worldbuilding, lore, or stories in their games; only a few titles are held as such. Making Engage hold to those standards feels unfair to me.Instead of comparing it to similar titles like Awakening or Fates, it gets the hatred that I don’t think it rightfully deserves. This game was never advertised to be like Three Houses; in fact, they were both made around the same time, and Intelligent Systems was intending for Engage to be completely different from Three Houses.But yeah, it is fair to say that I feel slightly jaded by this; it feels unfair to lay the blame on Engages feet just for releasing after a game like Three Houses. But nevertheless, let’s move on to one of my favorite parts of any Fire Emblem game.The Link Between Story and Gameplay: Your UnitsThe cast of Engage is one of my favorites to date! The characters feel more like the Awakening cast, showing a few traits at first but growing from those when seeing their supports. As of now, I have read every C support, so I have a good gist about each unit, but it is far from complete, so bear that in mind.Let’s start with your unit and main character, Alear. They have quite an interesting character, as they are very down-to-earth and relatable. They defy the norms of being a brave hero, being scared of the Corrupted, for example. They feel a bit like an Isekai protagonist, thanks to their amnesia, with which they eventually remember everything, unlike other amnesiacs like Robin.At first, I was neutral on Alear; I liked the design well enough and was expecting another Corrin-like affair. But suddenly, I’ve grown to really love Alear as a character, which I didn’t see coming! I think the first time that I thought this wasn’t like the others was when Alear woke from a thousand years of sleep and was escorted into Lythos Castle by their stewards.They suddenly get attacked by the Corrupted, In this single moment, Alear defies my expectations and says, “No, let’s run.” That was so refreshing for me! Seeing the main character as kind of a wimp really mixes it up. Intelligent Systems actually intended for Alear to be even more of a wimp, but Nintendo wasn’t too keen on that, so they compensated. But personally, I would love to see a more timid Alear! But luckily, the manga’s Alear seems to be based on Intelligent Systems original idea of them.I was hooked after that, and seeing them develop into a unique character even more is why I believe they are the key to Engage’s story. They’re now up there with my favorite Fire Emblem characters, second only to Robin!Here are a few other characters I quite enjoyed!Alfred is the first lord we recruit, and he’s my favorite lord in Engage! At first, like Alear, I was quite neutral about him, thinking he was a generic Dimitri, which, in hindsight, I can’t believe I ever thought! Like most of the cast, Alfred has basic traits for his character. He’s a huge muscle head and does everything to get stronger and build muscles. He’s part of the muscle trio along with Etie and Boucheron.But he’s much more than that! Diving on his support, he has an illness that he wants to keep secret from the others, with only Celine knowing his younger sister, which can be the reason why she drinks so much tea as a coping mechanism as her brother could die any day, as seen on their support when the illness they thought was gone was just being suppressed by him keeping his health up. It is quite depressing for such a bright game as Engage, but it is welcomed.I could talk about the other lords, but I don’t want to drag this out, so I will talk about one character that surprised me!Yunaka gets her own chapter to shine right after acquiring the fourth ring. Micaiah, after the battle, we get the best quote in Fire Emblem series history! “Hiya Papaya!” Such a weird but oddly fitting greeting for someone who presumably lives in Firene with their bountiful harvests!She’s an interesting character with a tragic backstory that I won’t spoil, but she’s a huge amount of fun! She does impressions—good ones, I say! and her critical quotes bringing out her darker side are just a chef’s kiss! She has many great supports as well!Alfred’s Confession.Alright, so to wrap up, here’s a list of my favorite support chains!      Alfred and Celine’s          As mentioned before, this support is rather sweet and sad and a must read if you want to know Alfred’s backstory.            Celine and Alcryst’s          Just the two talking about how best to support their brothers and being worried if something happens to them. is quite sweet.            Alear and Alfred’s          Alfred being overly caring as a friend and Alear just being mildly annoyed by it. Is a very sweet support and one of my favorite ships from this game.            Yunaka and Seadall’s          Yunaka tries performing with Seadall and is, of course, a natural! You could read this romantically or platonically, Either way a great support!      Overall, while the supports can be a bit short, there are some good ones in there! The cast of Engage is full of fun and zany characters. There’s something for everyone!Some Other ThoughtsI went around and gathered some thoughts about the game besides my own; some are positive and some are not. I wanted to gauge what the opinion of Engage is now that the game is close to being a year old. I got some interesting responses!  The writing is my biggest issue with the game. I disagree with the common sentiment that they wanted to make a simple plot that isn’t too serious, I think they tried and failed.If I’m being more specific my biggest gripe is probably with the over reliance on emotional, dialogue-heavy death scenes in the game. I think there’s roughly 7 or 8 which is far too many. They are used to try and force emotional moments and redeem characters, both of which were done very poorly imo.I like how they wrote the sibling relationships in engage  Matraiya  To be honest, the game look fine and has good music from what I’ve seen but I mainly avoided it due to the bad story remark I got. Like, you don’t need a good world. You could simply use basic concept and concentrate on the character. Problem is that this time is spent on the villain more than the heroes and well… they Peter Grffin themselves on the landing. I mean, you could have had the main story focusing on the conflict of the villain versus the heroes (Main Lord I mean) and have some cheesy/camp dialogue because that way, you attracted a crowd that would meme on it.  Anonymous  Gameplay wise the most frustrating thing has to be the low deployement slot. it’s not an engage only thing,  and i know part of it is that part of the cast size is meant to accomodate for deaths, however it’s still frustrating, cuz you don’t just bench objectively bad performers, you bench even fine units cuz there’s simply no spaceStory wise, probably that you could cut out the boat map from the story without much issues: it’s post the 6v6,  it’s not against the hounds, they don’t use a particularly outstanding strategy that could make up for the lack of emblems, and it doesn’t comment much on elusian themselves aside of lindon. A good map but actual filler.A bandit chapter would have been better  namu  Most frustrating thing about Engage (imo):-Undercooked lore. Needs more time in the oven. I’d prefer to add more nation/lords loreHaving to slog FX for characters every new save.What I enjoyed about Engage: Gameplay. Smooth, fun. Maps are pretty good. Characters are funWith enough effort, you can make anything work.  TBromine  Fun gameplay, story’s eh. The early-joining units are kinda atrociously balanced, and the game particularly fumbles the ball with regard to most female units’ build  Raxis  I love Fire Emblem and I thought that Engage was fine… And that is the problem. I’ve replayed TH many times, same with Fates, Awakening, FE7… But I just don’t feel like playing Engage again.I thought the Gameplay was good, but I just didn’t find it as gripping as Conquest’s or even Three Houses’ (unpopular opinion, I know :P)  Rodrieleven421Why is it My Game Of The Year?Phew! That was a long one, but yeah, I just had to gush about this game sometime! It is my game of the year for a reason!And why might you be asking, Why is it my game of the year? Well, I’m a huge fan of the Fire Emblem Series, and this was one of the games I was most excited for this year, and after playing some others, none of them could compare!I have played Star Ocean Second Story R as well as the Megaman Battle Network Legacy Collection, although I doubt that counts as it is a collection. I enjoyed both, but Star Ocean Second Story R really surprised me with his stunning graphics and fun gameplay! So even though I haven’t finished it yet, it gets my honorary mention.Going into 2024, I’m sure even more great games will be released, so I hope to continue this in its own series. For now, I’ll see you in a few weeks! Thanks to everyone who made this project possible! I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to rest since this took quite me some time piece together…"

    "content": "So I have been working on setting up an old Chromebook as a server—not using ChromeOS, mind you! I have installed custom firmware on the device, allowing me to install Endeavor OS on bare metal.Why Endeavor OS? It was the only distro to support all of the hardware on this device. Thanks to being just Arch preconfigured to be ready to use and Arch being a rolling distro, it has the latest drivers available, and thankfully, it has all the drivers for this old Chromebook!I’m not familiar with Arch at all, coming from Debian and Debian-based systems, so there is a fair bit to get used to!The main thing to learn is pacman Arch’s package manager, where you can install packages, update and upgrade the system, and more!For those unfamiliar with the command line, Arch is not the best distro to start with, but for us who mostly live in the shell, it isn’t that hard to get accustomed to!For example, coming from Debian, if you want to install a package, you use sudo apt install packagename You can accomplish the same thing with Arch with sudo pacman -S packagenameNow for updating and upgrading the system, if you’re familiar with Debian, then you know about sudo apt update,sudo apt upgrade and sudo apt full-upgrade. On Arch, though, we use sudo pacman -Syto update the system and sudo pacman -Syu for upgrading.To remove packages on Debian, we use sudo apt remove packagename. Now on Arch we use sudo pacman -R to do the same!But since Arch doesn’t have the best package support of all the Linux distros, you’re going to be building from source as well. Luckily, this is quite easy for with makepkg -s PKGBUILD, I have to do this with Discord since the package in the repo was outdated, but you may not have to! There’s always the AUR, and while I haven’t used it as much, it is worth checking there first before trying anything else, and hey, the AUR is a key feature of Arch!In conclusion, Arch is one of the better distros, and running on the bleeding edge has its benefits, while pacman can be confusing at first, at least for me! It is easy enough to grasp, and while it is not as verbose as ‘apt’, it is quite straightforward once you figure out what each command means. For the gamers out there, having a package manager named after an iconic game and seeing Pacman himself gobbling bytes when installing a package is super neat!"

Thought late, but better than never! Is going to be a big one, my biggest post yet, and is going to be a small Christmas present from me, dropping the 25th!I’m hoping you all enjoy it and leave your feedback.

    "content": "Well, hey there! It’s been a while, hasn’t it? I have been busy revamping this website and moving over to Cloudflare Pages, so before I go back to my regular posting, let me explain the process and what’s new this time around!So I started this website over on GitHub Pages, at the time, it was perfectly suited to my needs. I had just started learning web development and Git and was looking for free hosting solutions. I knew about Github Pages for awhile, so I gave that a shot. I decided to use a framework and went with Jekyll and started learning it, and I found that it was perfectly capable for my needs. It has built-in blog support, and it uses Markdown for posts and pages. I love Markdown, so this was a huge plus! You can also use plain HTML if you’re so inclined!I set up Jekyll with the default minima theme, which is just what I was looking for. It was simple and minimalistic, without too much fluff, and it continues to be my theme of choice.For awhile, I was content with GitHub Pages; it was one of the better options for free hosting, and using Git to manage my site worked like a dream. I wrote the majority of my posts using VSCode, so being able to commit changes from there was a timesaver!But I started to encounter a few things that bothered me, like the fact that the Jekyll version that GitHub Pages supports is quite old now! So I needed to be using the same version locally, or I would be getting error messages constantly. Using the GitHub Pages gem remedied this, but it was still annoying.The minima theme was also outdated, and there were some neat features—no necessary ones for me that I was missing out on. You could circumvent this by building from a remote theme, but frankly, that’s just more trouble than it’s worth, and worse of all, GitHub Pages has strict requirements for Jekyll gems and plugins that can be run or require older versions of them. This was stifling for me, to say the least.But luckily, I found out about Cloudflare Pages and that they provide an amazingly valuable free tier. I don’t know how or why it is free, but I’m not complaining!Like GitHub Pages, you can create a site with a framework like Jekyll or without a framework at all, and start from scratch if you prefer! Unlike GitHub Pages, you can use the latest version of Jekyll with his gems and plugins, and it supports Git integration, so you can continue to use Git to make changes!This allows me to use the newest minima theme with a new feature called skins, allowing you to choose from a variety of skins and more significantly auto.sccs for me, which allows me to have the light skin and dark skin change depending on the user’s system theme; no more flashbangs when reading at night! I promise you, this annoyed me more than you think!Here are the two skin versions you’ll see when browsing the site. I’m quite happy with both of them, but that may change later on.My website with the light skin applied, this was what you get regardless of your system theme back on the old site, glad thats behind us now! :)My website with the dark skin applied, safe for night readers!I also have free reign to experiment with other plugins and themes if I wish, but personally, I’m more content with running the latest versions of my framework and my theme, with all the handiness of using Git to manage them. In a way, it feels like I haven’t moved at all; I still commit to a repo on my GitHub, but now Cloudflare Pages takes care of the rest!"

Just use two pipe characters on the front and back of your text!Note that this is a special Markdown syntax that may only work on Discord and is not part of the standard Markdown spec.  I'm invisible!  I'm not invisible anymore; hide me, please. : _ ;ex:||I'm not invisible anymore; hide me, please. : _ ;|| ItalicsTo italicize text, all you need to do is add an asterisk to a sentence or word, both before and after. This will be the same for the following, so keep that in mind.Look at me, I’m pointy!ex:*Look at me, I'm pointy!*Underline ItalicsUnderlined italicization uses the same asterisk character but with the addition of two underscores at the end and beginning. This is a special Discord syntax and is not possible in regular Markdown, so keep that in mind.I'm still pointy but with a underline!ex:__*I'm still pointy but with a underline!*__UnderliningNow for just underlining, you just need to add two underscores front and back to your text. This also only works on Discord!Sometimes you just need some underlining, ya know?ex:__Sometimes you just need some underlining, ya know?__BoldingBut what if you want to give your text more importance? That’s where bolding comes in handy!Just add two asterisks! Remember, always front and back!I’m a ghost, boo!ex:**I'm a ghost, boo!**Underline BoldingBut what if you like some underline with that? Just add the same characters we use for underlining; that’s two underscores if you lost track. It happens to the best of us!I'm still a ghost, by the way!ex:__**I'm still a ghost, by the way!**__Bolding and ItalicsAnd if you want to be extra spicy, you can always italicize and bold at the same time with two underscores and three asterisk characters. This is different from regular Markdown, which uses just one underscore and two asterisk characters for the same effect.Just the thing you need when making a big point!ex:__***Just the thing you need when making a big point!__***StrikethroughSometimes you want to say something but want to keep it low-key; this is where strikethrough text comes to the rescue.Just add two tildes, front and back, to your text.Shh, don’t tell anyone. :Pex:~~Sshh, don't tell anyone. :P~~The Fun StuffNow for the really cool stuff you probably don’t know about! Like making bulleted lists, headers, masking links, sharing your code snippets with code blocks, and more, You can do quite a lot to make yours and others Discord experiences better thanks to Markdown!HeadersWith Discord adding forum-like features, it’s really handy to use a header for detailed articles or posts you want to share on Discord!Just add the hash character to make a header; be sure to leave a space before typing the header’s content. There are three header types!  ( # ) For a large header, just what you need for a tittle!  ( ## ) For a medium header, useful for sections on an article.  ( ### ) For a small header.ex:# Bigger is always better, right?## Not so big, but not too small either.### I'm just right! unlike the other two... Masked LinksYou can paste a link into the chat, but that is not the prettiest thing, right? Especially if Discord doesn’t have a preview, why not embed it in the text? Luckily, we can do that!Just use brackets for the text and parenthesis for the link, and you have a masked link!Check out my blog!ex:[Check out my blog!](https://reading.is-a.dev)ListsIt’s pretty self-explanatory: while you could list stuff with regular, good old plain text, you can make it even prettier with Markdown!Just use a hyphen before each item, and you can indent the list by adding two more extra spaces after the first bullet point.  Listing is fun!          right?          ex:- Listing is fun!  - right?Code BlocksOne of my favorites! It makes it a breeze to copy code; just add a backtick for one line of code or three if the code is multi-lined like a script.Just imagine this is a piece of code, Okay?See, isn’t that just better? Now all we need to do is double-click it to select it. Timesaver!ex:`Just imagine this is a piece of code, Okay?`Block QuotesFinally, sometimes you need to quote a piece of text; maybe you’re doing a book club. Regardless, this is where block quotes come in handy!Just add the greater-than character for a one-line block quote or three for a multiline one.  I can’t believe this guide is almost done!  It took me some days to finish this, but I’m quite relieved that it’s done. It was a fun side project, and I hope you can get some use out of it!ex:&gt; I can't believe this guide is almost done!&gt;&gt;&gt; It took me some days to finish this, but I'm quite relieved that it's done. It was a fun side project, and I hope you can get some use out of it! Wrapping upThat’s it. You now have a pretty good grasp on Markdown on Discord. So what’s next? I recommend looking into other Markdown guides if you want to get into the nitty-gritty of it and use it on other platforms! For now, I would love for you to use Markdown syntax on your favorite Discord servers and make the Discord experience better for everyone! I believe everyone should give Markdown a whirl; you may be surprised at how fun it is!"

    "content": "I was going to post about my neat home lab, but unfortunately, it didn’t work out. I was hosting a SMB file share and Jellyfin media server on a ten-year-old Samsung laptop. I had it lying around, and I thought it would be a good way to give new life to old hardware.And for a time, everything was well. It was so nice and handy to have a centralized place to store files without having to worry about syncing and such. It made things so much easier! But I digress.So, what was the culprit? Luckily, nothing serious happened. I was given this laptop, and the power adapter was defective. So I replaced it with a cheap one I found online. For the price, it lasted longer than expected. I replaced it around 2019, so not bad overall!Now I could buy another replacement adapter and have everything running again in no time. But personally, if I’m going to invest in this old hardware again, I might as well get something smaller and more energy-efficient.I could buy another replacement adapter and have everything up and running again in no time. However, I don’t think it’s worth investing in this old hardware again. I’d rather get something smaller and more energy-efficient.For now, I guess I’m back to good old syncing. Which is not bad at all, by any means!But if you know of any good Raspberry Pi alternatives that are also in the same price range, please let me know!"

Hopefully you’re feeling better than me because I’ve been sick for the second time this month, and well, it definitely made blogging hard this month. Among other things, I was planning to write and publish a new post about me decommissioning my home server due to a power supply failure (yep, that is also a bummer but more of a blessing in disguise in my view). and I’ve started writing a Fire Emblem Engage review, which I would be able to finish once I’ve finished my second run of the game with all of the DLC. That way, I can cover everything and give my full opinion of the game now that it has been out for four months.Regardless, I’m writing this short post now because I wanted to publish one post each month at least, but to make up for it, I’m going to do my best to publish two posts next month, one of which is the mentioned home server post, and the other is likely to be the Fire Emblem Engage review. With that said, I’m going to get some rest, and hopefully I don’t get sick again this year."

    "content": "The new Pokémon anime series has dropped in Japan! and I have some mostly positive thoughts about it. Bear in mind that this post contains spoilers for the first three episodes. give our take.First of all, I can’t believe that The Pokémon Company decided to end the last protagonist’s journey. I had long resigned myself to the fact that it would never happen, so I was happily surprised! A worthwhile change in my opinion, although I don’t feel it’s the only change to be made to make a suberb Pokémon anime; length and structure are also important, but I digress.From what I’ve watched so far, the show has shattered my low expectations! I’ll start with the new cast, starting with Liko, our new protagonist. She is an introverted girl, which seems to cause her social anxiety. (I can relate.) and is enrolled in a new school in Kanto (yes, again), and she is originally from Paldea.As for Roy, he seems to be in search of treasure and legendary Pokémon; if the opening is anything to go by, he had a chance encounter with a shiny Rayquaza and may be looking for it. I don’t have much opinion about him as of now because I’ve seen characters like him before, and he has a lot of similarities with the last deuteragonist.Nevertheless, he has another likely plot device, and I wonder what they are planning with it other than a Pokémon residing within it because Liko’s pendant has that covered.But with that out of the way, the other cast is just as interesting and, in my opinion, more interesting than the protagonists: we have the Rising Volt Tacklers, a group of five individuals led by Friede, who is a Pokémon Professor but keeps it under tight wraps.So far, the show has given him a bit of the spotlight, and he feels like a more prominent character in the first two episodes. I’m not sure if it will continue like this, but I hope it does! He’s an intriguing character who seems to treat his team well, but he’s also flawed, which has all the makings of a good character, in my opinion. Let’s just hope they keep it this way; the other members are interesting as well and have a starting slate of personalities. I do hope they evolve from their basic traits (pun not intended), but so far, each is pretty interesting, in my opinion.The evildoers this time around seem to be more multifaceted, which is nothing groundbreaking but makes it more enjoyable. Amethio is surprising young to be in this role, and Team Explorers have worked well to move the plot forward so far. Talking about the plot, there’s actually an overarching plot here so far, an improvement from the last series, which was very episodic.This one can also become episodic later on, but so far, it looks like the writers are trying to keep it fresh. Other than the Brave Asagi being their home base, the story hasn’t had a static element that I have noticed.But to wrap up, since this is already longer than planned, I’m quite happy with the new series so far! To be fair, a lot could still go wrong, but I’m enjoying the ride so far! If you like Pokémon, I recommend giving it a shot. It’s not my ideal dream Pokémon anime series by a long shot, but it’s enjoyable enough to watch, and that may be enough for you!"
