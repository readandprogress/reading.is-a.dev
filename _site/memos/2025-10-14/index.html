<p>Been playing the demo to Trails of the Sky: 1st Chapter, and I’m really enjoying it so far. I tried other Trails games before but they never fully clicked with me but now I definitely see the appeal! Still trying complete Valkyrie Chronicles 4 at the side, I think I’ll do the last chapter on Hard and take a break from it.</p>

<p>Is spooky season, so I think I’ll fired up AI:The Somnium Files again.</p>

<p>Besides that, I’ve started watching <a href="/anime/digimon-beatbreak">Digimon Beatbreak</a>, I completely forgot it was airing but that just means I have more episodes to watch right away!</p>
