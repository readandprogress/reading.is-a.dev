<p>As you may have noticed I have completely lean on tags and removed categories, while I don’t want to go to deep here as I’m a writing post going over all the changes. I do want to express why briefly.</p>

<p>Which really just boils down to both doing practically the same job but in different ways and having both was just making my life more difficult for no reason. I also really like that I can branch out as much as like with tags but that’s also its biggest weakness, so I’m trying to keep my tag list as minimal as possible.</p>
