  <title>The Reading Dimension</title>
  <subtitle>Welcome to my own little corner of the web! Here, I muse about a variety of topics, mostly tech-related, but I also dabble in others like anime, manga, writing, and gaming as well! (•‿•)</subtitle>

  <summary>I&amp;#39;ve been having trouble writing fiction as of late. I have this original work that I have been mulling over for a while now and really like to get the first chapter out this year, but all I managed to write was some of the worldbuilding, CVs, and some notes.</summary>

  <summary>Recently, I&amp;#39;ve been dealing with transferring large files, and while there are plenty of tools available to do the job, most of them are slow, have a size limit, or are cumbersome to set up.
