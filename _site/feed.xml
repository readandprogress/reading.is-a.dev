  <summary>Writing can be hard and sometimes almost nigh impossible; it is something you have to be in the right mindset for.
For me, I don't have trouble staying motivated once I start; I can stay in the flow state for long periods of time. My problem more so comes from starting.</summary>

  <summary>Yes, apparently so! I'm still flabbergasted, but dates don't lie, do they? It has been two years since the start of this digital garden, formerly a blog, all the way back to my first post in March 2023. Wild!</summary>

I use VS Code as my Markdown editor of choice for writing these posts and taking notes, but I recently learned about a new Markdown notetaking app that caught my interest, so I’ve decided to take it for a spin!  The app is called Inkdown and is by far the best Markdown notetaking app I have the pleasure of usi...</summary>
