I've been trying out Capacities, and I'm really liking it! I like how simple and yet extensive it can be. I'm not a huge fan of having my notes in the cloud or SaaS (Software as a Service) for that matter, but!  Unlike other similar note taking apps, Capacities does have a full export[1^] feature, and it isn't just a dump.

It exports everything into markdown and other open formats, with support for wikilinks and titles as H1 headings! The file names are also straightforward being just whatever you title your notes as. And better yet, you can automate the exports into a local folder. So you could back them up and version control them with Git[2^] if you like.  Which make me feel less apprehensive about using apps/services like these. I don't know, we'll see how I feel after some more time with it. :)

#### Footnotes
[1^]: It doesn't have a full import feature though, that would've save some time at first.  
[2^]: I do wish it had built-in Git integration, missed opportunity to be honest.
