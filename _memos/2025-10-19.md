Got back to Valkyria Chronicles 4 and 
I finally cleared Chapter 18 on hard difficulty! Finally unlocking the epilogue. This games is such a ride...

Is one of those games that makes you reflect on the amazing experience you just had! I'm really hoping another entry is in the works. Fingers crossed!

Aside from gaming I've been watching the latest season of To Your Eternity, so far so good. Really digging the modern setting.
