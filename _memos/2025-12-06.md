After spending some time tinkering around with capacities.io, these last few weeks. I've decided to pack up my stuff and go back to something easy and simple. As always. :)

This time, I'm really enjoying writing paper notes again! Along with a nice new journal that sits at my desk. I now capture all of my thoughts within it. That includes: journal entries, thoughts about the games I'm playing and any notes that could be useful later on. The same could be said for the anime, manga and music and that I watch, read and listen too.

I also like drawing a small silhouette of the current weather and a simple flowchart depicting my mood when I sit down to write in it. I also been logging my weight on it too. Well, when I remember to check my weight that is lol

Really happy with this note system for now. When is time to start a new journal I might archive the pages by OCRed them to to my evergreen pages on my laptop, which are synced with Git to Github for peace of mind. :)
