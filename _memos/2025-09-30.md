I finally finished revamping my site just in time for the start of spooky month! There's still a lot I want to work on but I feel relatively happy on how it is now. I usually like to publish a post per month but now that I have a `/memos` page, I don't feel the need to post as frequently but I am going to publishing a new short post tomorrow detailing the updates I made to the site, I also have a much bigger post plan for November as well, so keep your eyes open for that one!
