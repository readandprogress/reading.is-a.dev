Whelp, a week has passed but unfortunately due to unforeseen events with the weather, writing was far from being the most important thing in my mind these last couple of days...

But it's not all doom and gloom. There's always a silver lining, as they say. The biggest nugget of knowledge that I got from this experience is that a week is not at all enough time to brainstorm ideas, regardless of the situation. One of my downfalls is that I tend to think things take less time than they actually do. Heh-heh.

Nonetheless, you need to be in a certain mood to brainstorm. Turns out that my mood changed after I wrote and published that last post. Who would have dunked it?

## The Results

To make this easier to parse, I'm formatting the following entries as their own headings!

### Day 1 - Monday

I was pretty optimistic starting out; I started a new draft for the blog as a warm-up, per se. Which was great, but I started to lose steam when it came to actually diving in on my original project, so I never got started. Not a great start, but I'll take what I can get.

### Day 2 - Tuesday

This was a nothing burger, plain and simple; nothing got done this day for a very good reason. This was the day I was informed about the then new storm coming to our part of town, and all I was thinking was that I needed to get prepared for the worst since you never know with these storms and that it has to be *now*.

### Day 3 - Wednesday

The day was much the same as the last, except I was really in preparation mode, so most of my day was assigned to that task. This is also the day when the storm hit us late in the night. Luckily, we were unscathed by the brunt of the damage the storm wrecked upon our state. Others weren't so lucky...

### Day 4 - Thursday

We lost power for a few hours since Wednesday, and luckily just as I woke up, the power returned! Now, everyone was not so lucky, unfortunately, and some still to this day have no power. Since things were starting to become normal again, I took it easy and went back into my usual routine.

### Day 5 - Friday

Another nothing burger; not much progress other than I was able to get back in the flow of other things going on in my life. It started to feel like any other day.

### Day 6 - Saturday

I finally have something to report! I was able to work on a draft that became this post and another one that you'll be seeing soon! Other than blogging, I kind of gave up on the challenge since then. I wasn't in the right headspace yet, and I didn't want to force myself either. Sigh, it is what it is, I guess.

### Final Day - Sunday

Much the same as the last one; I made more progress on a rather interesting draft (well, in my view at least!) from earlier, and that was rather enjoyable. I also started to gather my thoughts on the week and couldn't help but feel a sense of dread for not following through with my own imposed challenge, but what can you do when life throws you lemons?

## Wrapping up

Like I said, not the best start to a week that I set myself out to work on my writing project, but even so, I'm not giving up on the overall goal of making any progress on this beloved work of mine before the end of the year.

With that said, I have reorganized my schedule to have a few hours dedicated to writing on Wednesdays! I feel like having a few hours in a day of the week is a better way for me to focus. Since my hobbies are pretty varied, focusing on too many things every day seems like an easy way to get overwhelmed and burned out in the end. Anyways! Here's hoping for better writing sessions in my future.
