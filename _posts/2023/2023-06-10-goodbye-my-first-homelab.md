I was going to post about my neat home lab, but unfortunately, it didn't work out. I was hosting a SMB file share and Jellyfin media server on a ten-year-old Samsung laptop. I had it lying around, and I thought it would be a good way to give new life to old hardware.

And for a time, everything was well. It was so nice and handy to have a centralized place to store files without having to worry about syncing and such. It made things so much easier! But I digress.

So, what was the culprit? Luckily, nothing serious happened. I was given this laptop, and the power adapter was defective. So I replaced it with a cheap one I found online. For the price, it lasted longer than expected. I replaced it around 2019, so not bad overall!

Now I could buy another replacement adapter and have everything running again in no time. But personally, if I'm going to invest in this old hardware again, I might as well get something smaller and more energy-efficient.

For now, I guess I'm back to good old syncing. Which is not bad at all, by any means!

But if you know of any good Raspberry Pi alternatives that are also in the same price range, please let me know!
