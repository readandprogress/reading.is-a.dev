I recently read a post[^1] by Kev Quirk[^2], about his computing history, and it seemed like a fun topic, so I'm going to put my own twist on it!

I've been into computing for two decades now—yes, I'm old. (◔‿◔)

In that time, I have gone through four computers: one laptop and three desktops, experimenting with several operating systems and applications!

## 1999 - 2004 Compaq Presario 7400 Series

<p style="text-align:center">Not my exact model or picture, but is the closest to the one we had back then!</p>

<br>

My first PC, or should I say our first family computer, was a Compaq Presario 7400 series desktop tower. I'm not sure of the precise model, but I remember it had a Pentium 3 CPU, 64 MB of RAM, a 30GB HDD, and ran on Windows 98. It even came with an upgrade CD to Windows 98 SE!

I have fond memories of playing games, going online for the first time, and slowly learning more about computers during that period. I remember reading both the accompanying manuals quite frequently; it was the closest thing to scratching the itch when the computer was occupied by my father or sister.

It eventually became my own computer when my dad upgraded to a new custom-built PC and my sister bought herself a laptop. Even though it was a hand-me-down, I was quite happy to have a PC all to myself!

Although I don't use Windows anymore, Windows 98 will always have a special spot in my heart!


## 2004 - 2009 Custom Built Pentium 4 Desktop

Around the time I was in middle school, my dad surprised me with a custom-built PC! I don't know much about its components, but it had a Pentium 4 CPU, 1GB of RAM, 300GB HDD, internal graphics, and a copy of Windows XP. It was a good machine and it worked terrifically well!

Windows XP was also more stable than Windows 98, so it made for a pleasant experience. However, unlike 98, I hold no love for XP; Sorry XP Fans!

This was also the time when I became more interested in Linux! I had read about it before and was intrigued, but this is when I learned more about it and started ordering those free Live CDs! Fun times.

## 2009 - 2014 HP Pavilion Slimline s5600 Series

<p style="text-align:center">The Pavilion Slimline Case still holds up in my opinon!</p>

<br>

When I enrolled in university for my major in Computer Science, I needed a new machine because my old one was left at my dad's when we moved, and it was time for an upgrade!

I was advised to get a laptop, which in hindsight was probably the best choice. However, I was stubborn and preferred the repairability and power of a desktop since I rarely needed to leave my desk. So, I received an HP Pavilion Slimline desktop as a gift from my mom. Its slim case was perfect for my desk space, and it looked great too! It featured a Pentium Duo CPU, my first dual-core CPU, 4GB of RAM, a 500GB HDD, Intel HD internal graphics, and a copy of Windows 7 Home Premium.

This machine was fantastic! It ran smoothly without any issues and was quite impressive for an entry-level rig at that time!

Windows 7 was also pleasant to use. Even though I was already using Linux and enjoying it, I decided to stick with Windows 7 on this machine. I eventually installed Kubuntu, and it ran fantastically!


## 2014 - 2018 The Dark Era 

During late 2014 I moved over to Florida and with it I parted away with a lot of my stuff including my trusty HP, I didn't want to lug it all the way and it was already bit out of date anyways.

This was what I called my *dark* era of computing since I effectively didn't have a computer until late 2018 making do with tablets and later a smartphone. Not the best of times for me personally either, it was a *dark* era indeed.

## 2018 - Current Asus C101PA 3in1 Chromebook

<p style="text-align:center">My current computer and my first Notebook PC!</p>

<br>

By this time, I had gotten my first job at a Mexican restaurant and could afford to buy my own computer! After saving up all the earnings I could from tip-wage work, I was able to purchase a not very glamorous but good enough for me Chromebook!

It was the best for the price and very portable, something that I warmed up to as I grew up. All I needed was a device that allowed me to study, take notes, take tests, do some light coding, and light web browsing, and this small ASUS delivered that in spades!

It's also a convertible, which makes it extra handy when laying on the bed or setting it up in tent mode, for example, in the kitchen!

It packs a Hexacore Rockchip CPU, 4GB of RAM, 16GB eMMC, and runs Chrome OS. I know those are underwhelming specs, but it works for me. 

I have been feeling its age now that it's doesn't get any more updates (Auto-Update Expiry), and I tend to push its limits sometimes by running Linux apps on top of a container called Crostini, but it still has plenty of life in it.

I will replace it as my main device soon. Once I have an apartment, I'm planning on either building my own or getting one of these small but powerful mini PCs!

## What about you?

Regardless, I'm interested in your computing history as well! Did you have a "dark" era like me? What operating systems have you used? Are you more of a laptop or desktop person? Let me know via my new contact page! ^_^
