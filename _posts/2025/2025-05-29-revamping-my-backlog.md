I've been quite happy with my backlog since I added it back in January, but now I'm closing in on the middle of the year. I like to rework it a little. The page itself won't change much, but in the spirit of transitioning to a digital garden, I'm adding dedicated pages to each entry in the log. Where I can have notes, summaries, and screenshots all in one place for media. Like a commonplace book but online.

To do this, I've been painstakingly creating each and every page for each entry. I already have a template in mind, and while I was doing this, I thought it would be neat to guide you all through the progress, a developer log if you will!

## Creating Entry Pages

Since the backlog itself is done, all I'm doing is creating a page for each entry and linking them to the main backlog page.

![My Fire Emblem Engage Entry Page](/assets/images/2025-05-29-revamping-my-backlog/fire-emblem-engage-entry-page.png){: .shadow }

As you can see in this page, I have the name of the game as the title, and I use key art from the game as a preview image..

I added more information about it on the frontmatter and created a custom layout to display the extra frontmatter on the page, followed by an overview, and then lastly the notes.

Here's another example, but for an anime instead. The layout is identical, except the frontmatter.

![My entry page for the anime: Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX](/assets/images/2025-05-29-revamping-my-backlog/mobile-suit-gundam-gquuuuuux-entry-page.png){: .shadow }

## Linking the New Pages to the Main Backlog Page

Now all that's remaining to do is linking the newly created pages to their dedicated entries in the main backlog page.

I use relative links using their permalinks:

```markdown
[**Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX**](/media/anime/mobile-suit-gundam-gquuuuuux/)
```

and voila!

Clicking on an entry opens its respective page. This is the only way to reach these pages, as they're hidden from the navigation bar to keep it tidy!

## What's Next?

Like I said, I'm still working on these, but I already have more things I'd like to add, like linking the games, anime, etc. to their official pages for those of you who are curious and want to know more, and adding a *"See also"* section to link articles or posts that mention it.

For now, I hope this was helpful if you're thinking of doing something similar. If you checked my backlog page, you may have noticed that I've been watching Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX, and I've been enjoying it greatly! Currently taking notes, and I plan on writing a mid-season review for it next month. Stay tuned!
