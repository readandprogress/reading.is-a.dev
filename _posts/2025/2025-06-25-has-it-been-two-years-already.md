Yes, apparently so! I'm still flabbergasted, but dates don't lie, do they? It has been two years since the start of this digital garden, formerly a blog, all the way back to my first post in March 2023. Wild!

This website changed a lot during those years, so much so it is unrecognizable from its first design back when I was very inexperienced and didn't know what the heck I was doing most of the time.

But even so, I wouldn't trade my time spent messing around with my _config.yml or any of the many configuration files that make this site possible. This whole experience has been a huge boon in learning the ropes, but also being hands-on has helped me learn things I would've never learned from reading docs, guides, and such.

Not only was this site a gateway to learning web development, it also helped me start writing in general again. After all, those posts won't write themselves. Now it is an ingrained habit; after all, I need to keep up with my monthly quota.

I'm also slowly getting back to writing fiction again! That wouldn't have been possible at all if I hadn't exercised those muscles again.

All in all, this site has been instrumental for me. I had three major reasons why I started this site. As mentioned earlier, two of them were learning web development and improving my writing. My last reason was to have a place on the web of my very ownâ€”not dependent on any platform, a place where I know my content will stay up as much as I want it to.

Needless to say, I love my little corner of the web. It is a piece of myself I hold dearly and probably one of the best ongoing projects I ever started!

Before I go, I want to thank you all for reading and following this website! It means a lot to me. I started this mostly for myself, but seeing other people read my stuff has been eye-opening! I never expected for this site to get much of any following at all, but the analytics don't lie, do they? (Unless they're bots. Don't think I don't see you guys there lurking around scraping data.)

But really, thank you all! Your support means a lot to me.

See you next time!
