I have always found it fascinating what others name their computers and devices. Just like finding funny and unique Wi-Fi names, it is a small window into someone's interests and personality.

So allow me to share my own!

As a big fan of the [Gundam](https://en.gundam.info/what-is-gundam/) universe, I've stuck with a naming scheme around their characters and technology.

- **Chromebook**: My daily driver is fittingly named after one of my favorite characters from all of Gundam! [Sayla](https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Sayla_Mass).
- **Debian Container**: Artesia. I also run a Debian container for coding and such, and naming it after the birth name of the aforementioned Sayla sounds appropriate.
- **Tablet**: Named after [Chan](https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Chan_Agi) from the movie *Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack*.
- **Nintendo Switch Lite**: I have a turquoise one, so I thought [Emma](https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Emma_Sheen) from *Mobile Suit ZETA Gundam* would be a good choice.
- **iPhone**: Similarly to my Switch Lite, I picked [Beltorchika](https://gundam.fandom.com/wiki/Beltorchika_Irma) due to the color of the device.
- **Mi Band**: I wear this fitness tracker almost 24/7. Since it is mostly in contact with me, I named it: [Contact Link](https://antifandom.com/gundam/wiki/Gundam_Wiki:Technology#Contact_Link). Clever, eh? (•‿•)
- **Sony Headphones**: My main pair of headphones is named [Minosky Particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gundam_Universal_Century_technology#Minovsky_particle), ironically after a particle that disrupts radio communications in the series.

I have been using this naming scheme for years now, and I've been very happy with it! No telling what the future holds, but here's hoping I stick with this naming scheme for the long haul!
