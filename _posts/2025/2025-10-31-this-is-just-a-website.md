I've been mulling it over for the last couple of weeks, months even. About how I want to go about my site. I was very interested and looking forward to making it into something similar to a digital garden, but as I continue to develop it going forward. I'm starting to realize that I'm overcomplicating it with unnecessary additions that, in my opinion, don't really add much value.

While I enjoy the process of adding these features, I don't particularly care to maintain them. So, I opted to simplify my site instead, just like I've been aiming to do with a lot of aspects of my life. 

With that said, I've decided to move away from this being a [Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), while novel, I find it to be a confusing name for regular folk who barely know the difference between a site or a blog, much less a digital garden or any other kind of site. The terminology, while fun, can be pretty confusing as well.

I'm a big proponent of making the web more accessible, especially the small web. Regardless of who clicks on a link to get here, I want them to be able to navigate through my site easily and intuitively. 

While I still like and want to incorporate some of the features digital gardens have, I aim to implement them in a more simple and streamlined way. 

KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) is a philosophy I always go back to. It's easy to feel allured by the new and shiny. It's a trap I often find myself in. But in the end I always go back to basics.

This is [*just*](https://actualwebsite.org/) a website, which so happens to contain posts, memos, and, in the near future, articles. In a way, it's like going back to the web's roots, where blogs weren't really a thing. We just had sites, that sometimes had sometime akin to them. But it wasn't the sole focus. To be honest, I quite liked that; it really made them personable and unique. :)
