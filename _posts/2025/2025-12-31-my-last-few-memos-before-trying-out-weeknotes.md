description: "Happy New Year Folks! I've been pretty busy, so I haven't had the time that I hoped I did to write these posts, my _drafts directory just keeps on growing lol. But, I didn't want to not have anything out for this month, so here's a collection of my memos that I've publlished so far. Next week or so, I'll be trying out the weeknotes format, hoping it sticks!"

> I finally finished revamping my site just in time for the start of spooky month! There's still a lot I want to work on but I feel relatively happy on how it is now. I usually like to publish a post per month but now that I have a `/memos` page, I don't feel the need to post as frequently, but I am going to publishing a new short post tomorrow detailing the updates I made to the site, I also have a much bigger post plan for November as well, so keep your eyes open for that one!

> Can't believe we're already in October! But on the bright side, Pokémon Legends ZA will be out soon! Currently, replaying Pokémon Yellow while I wait. :)

> As you may have noticed I have completely lean on tags and removed categories, while I don't want to go to deep here as I'm a writing post going over all the changes. I do want to express why briefly. <br> Which really just boils down to both doing practically the same job but in different ways and having both was just making my life more difficult for no reason. I also really like that I can branch out as much as like with tags but that's also its biggest weakness, so I'm trying to keep my tag list as minimal as possible.

> Been a while, hasn't it? I'm still pretty busy so I haven't had the chance to write the update post yet, but the weekend is coming up and I should've plenty of time to write it and maybe add some new features? We'll see. <br> I'm really looking forward to it! :)

> Been playing the demo to Trails of the Sky: 1st Chapter, and I'm really enjoying it so far. I tried other Trails games before but they never fully clicked with me but now I definitely see the appeal! Still trying complete Valkyrie Chronicles 4 at the side, I think I'll do the last chapter on Hard and take a break from it. <br> Is spooky season, so I think I'll fired up AI:The Somnium Files again. <br> Besides that, I've started watching Digimon Beatbreak), I completely forgot it was airing but that just means I have more episodes to watch. :)

> Got back to Valkyria Chronicles 4 and 
I finally cleared Chapter 18 on hard difficulty! Finally unlocking the epilogue. This games is such a ride... <br> Is one of those games that makes you reflect on the amazing experience you just had! I'm really hoping another entry is in the works. Fingers crossed. <br> Aside from gaming I've been watching the latest season of To Your Eternity, so far so good. Really digging the modern setting.

> I've been trying out Capacities, and I'm really liking it! I like how simple and yet extensive it can be. I'm not a huge fan of having all of my notes in the cloud or SaaS (Software as a Service) for that matter, But! Unlike other similar note taking apps, Capacities does have a full export feature, and isn't just a dump. <br> It exports everything into Markdown and other open formats, with support for wikilinks and titles as H1 headings! The file names are also straightforward being just whatever you title your notes as. And better yet, you can automate the exports into a local folder. So you could back them up and version control them with Git if you like.  Which make me feel less apprehensive about using apps/services like these. I don't know, we'll see how I feel after some more time with it. :)

> After spending some time tinkering around with capacities.io, these last few weeks. I've decided to pack up my stuff and go back to something easy and simple. As always. <br> This time, I'm really enjoying writing paper notes again! Along with a nice new journal that sits at my desk. I now capture all of my thoughts within it. That includes: journal entries, thoughts about the games I'm playing and any notes that could be useful later on. The same could be said for the anime, manga and music and that I watch, read and listen as well. <br>I also like drawing a small silhouette of the current weather and a simple flowchart depicting my mood when I sit down to write in it. I also been logging my weight on it too. Well, when I remember to check my weight that is lol. <br> Really happy with this note system. When is time to start a new journal I might archive the pages by OCRed themmto my evergreen pages on my laptop, which are synced with Git to Github for peace of mind.
