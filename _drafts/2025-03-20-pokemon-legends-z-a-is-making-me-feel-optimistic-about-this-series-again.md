Pokemon Day came and went and left us with a new trailer for the upcoming Pokemon Legends Z-A and I have some thoughts on it.

Now since I kept my expectations in checked, I wasn't overtly hyped for news. So I didn't even try to catch the Presents at the crack of dawn. Pun intended. 

After getting some brunch, I click on the Presents and after waiting trough a bunch moble game updates, blegh and watching the teaser for Champions a new battle simualtor type game? That looks vaguely interesting I finally got to the new trailer and I must say I was pleasntly suprised!

To my pleasant suprised the visuals are indeed cell-shaded, although it uses the Scarlet & Violet style and not a similar style to the former game Legends Arceus. I really love the the artstyle for the latter and is a shame then didn't do something similar but with a more french look. Luckily it still looks suprisingly good and clean! A huge upgrade from the visuals of Scarlet & Violet in my opinion and what's more is that they went back to more stylized textures for the Pokemon and the seem to have new models with more saturated colors! I for one am extremely happy for this change. I was not at all a fan of the realistic textures in Scarlet and Violet.

I'm glad that my previuos worried we're unfounded, as I mentioned back in a older post, I was worried that the teams over at Game Freak we're going in a new direction visually, a dirrection i didn't like as a veteran Pokemon fan. So far this new game looks to be going in the right direction for once in my humble opinion.

FIrst we have the new player characters. I like their designs quite a lot and unlike Scarlet and Violet's these have returned to have their signature oval eyes that makes player characters unique in this series.
