Pokemon Day came and went and left us with a new trailer for the upcoming Pokemon Legends Z-A and i have some thoughts on it.

Now since I kept my expectations in checked, I wasn't overtly hyped for news. So I didn't even try to catch the Presents at the crack of dawn. Pun intended. 

After getting some brunch, I click on the Presents and after waiting trough a bunch moble game updates, blegh and watching the teaser for Champions a new battle simualtor type game? That looks vaguely interesting I finally got to the new trailer and I must say I was pleasntly suprised!
