I was going to write a post about my adventures with homelabing, on a old Chromebook that I've repurposed for it. What can I say? I really do enjoy repurposing old tech!

But after a few months tinkering with Alpine Linux, and Docker containers. I find that I may be over complicating my setup. Especially since I'm using legacy hardware.

I've decided to wipe it clean and set-up good 'ol reliable Debian. Which just recently had a new release; Trixie.

So far, I'm really engoying it. I miss OpenRC the most, but since I'm only hosting [Jellyfin]() for now is not much of a downgrade.
