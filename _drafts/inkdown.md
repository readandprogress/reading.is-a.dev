As I said back in a earlier post, I decided to go back to Markdown for all my notes. I use VS code as my Markdown editor of choice for writing these posts to taking notes but I recently learned about a new Markdown notetaking app that caught my interest so I've decided to take it for a spin!

The app is called Inkdown and is by far the best markdown notetaking app I have the pleasure of using and I tried several others but none of them are as simple and intuative as Inkdown is in my opinion. Apps like Logseq and Obsidian are simple and minimal at first but the try to accomplish to much in my opinion. At their base they're just Markdown editors with unnecessary fluff on top, so much so that the final Mardown file is barely unreconizable and loses all out on is portability, something that these apps proudly highlight on their websites, ironically.

On the other hand Inkdown keeps it simple, no plugins, no database just plain Markdown. Using GitHub's Flacored Markdown to be specific so you can get extended markdown syntax like checkboxes, tables etc and if that's not enough for you Inkdown has built in for Mermaid and LaTex as well and if that still isn't enough Inkdown uses HTML to add even more features like iframes, higlighting etc. You have all the capability you need without affecting the portability of the final Markdown file. After all is just plain Markdown, Mermaid, LaTex and HTML. 

Inkdown is curently available for MacOS and Windows but it also has a PWA(Progressive Web App). Which is the version I'm using. All versions has the same feature sets. There's also a VS Code extension if you just don't wan't to leave VS Code but like Inkdown's WYIWYG editor. It has all the same features as well. 

I haven't messed much with the extension yet, I'm quite happy using the app and I like having a dedicated app for my notes. What can I say I like the compartalization.
