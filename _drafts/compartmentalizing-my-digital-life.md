I previously mentioned some of my devices in a post where I share their names. Yes, I'm one of those weird people that do in fact name their electronics for fun and for praticality!

Nevertheless I recently been thinking of comparmetalizing my usage of them more after taking a brief digital detox from my phone.

I realixed that if I want to stick to healhy habits I should remove any barriers that prevent from executing them. 

## Screen Time Troubles

My screen time on my phone (an iPhone6s for those wondering, yes is *ancient* but it still does what I need no less no more.) has grown exponetinaly a few weeks ago, topping a average of four hours!

Thankfully I managed to cut back on it a lot and the main culprit to no suprise to anyone nevertheless myself was **Discord**.

I then with a heavy heart decided that I can't trust myself to keep Discord on my phone anymore, as much as I would love to! 

I just spend way too much time there given the option, and no setting app limits don't work for me, plus one of of the major reasons I have it on my phone is for notifications and if I run out of time I won't receive any!

To combat this I reactivated email notifications back on Discord, and set up mail notifications on my Mi band so I still get them there.

I can then finally delete the app from my phone!

Now my screen time on my phone sits around thirty minutes on average, maybe a hour plus when on the go. Now I mostly use it for communication (calls, messages and email.), navigation, audio (Music and Podcasts), light web browsing, Read RSS feeds on the go, taking photos, server management and other handy tools to have when on the go.

The goal is that everytime I pick it up, is for an intentional use case, no just aimlessly wandering about, the only app I have that can be consider aimless is NetNewsWire for RSS but I only use it on the go, since I already have a reading habit with a device deeply associate it with it that my being my tablet.

## Reading, but wait isn't that *me*?!

As my display name implies, I love reading! Mostly non-fiction and technical documentation but I do dabble in fiction once in a while.

Everytime I wake up, ussualy in the morning, hey no judging. I pick up my tablet and jump right into ReadYou my RSS app of choice or if there isn't anything new or interesting I open Stump straight away and continue where I left off on a book. I ussually do this for half an hour sometimes more, it all depends on my mood, if I'm particurlarly hungry etc. 

I've been habitually doing this for almost a year now and it really got me to read more and read better. Can't recommend it enough if you struggle with reading, setting a dedicated time everyday to read does wonders!

Later on I like to get a dedicated eReader but right now Reading is half what I mostly use my tablet for the other and half is entertainment.

## Reading In The Mornings and Watching at Night 

After I finish with my day I like to wind down with a video or two or a episodes of a show I'm watching.

My tablet is the best device for this task with HiDPI IPS screen and just large enough to comfortably hold and watch for hours.

Is only 1280x720 but it's HiDPI screen makes up for it.

Her I have Findroid my Jellyfin Client of choice and YouTube Revqnced Extended to get rid of those pesky ads.

Fjndroid is for watching my shows and movies and RVX for videos and listening and discovering to music.
