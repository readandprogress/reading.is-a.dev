I'm being quite happy with my backlog since I added it back in January but now closing in on the middle of the year. I like to rework it a little. The page itself won't chnage much but in the spirit of transitioning to a digital garden, I'm adding dedicated pages to each entry in the log. Where I can have notes, sumaries and screenshots all in one place for a spcific media. Like a commonplace book but online. 

To do this I've been painstakingly creating each and every page and adding some basic info to start. I already have a template in mind and while I was doing this I thought it would be neat to guide you all trough the progress, a developer log if you will.

## Creating Entry Pages

Since the backlog itself is done all I'm doing is creating a page for each entry and linking them to the main backlog page.

<|------ --------|>

As you can see in this page, I have the name of the game as the title and I use key art from the game as a header image.

I added more information about it in the frontmatter and created a custom layout to display the extra frontmatter on the page. Followed by a summary an then lastly the notes.

Here's another example but for a anime instead. The layout is identical except the frontmatter.

I use some HTML for the carousle of screenshot images. Everything else is plain markdown.

## Linking the New Pages to the Main Backlog Page

Now all that's remaining to do is linking the new created page to it's dedicated entries in the main backlog page.

I use relative links.

```html
[]()
```
and voila!

Cliking on a entry opens is repectful page. This is the only way to reach these pages. Keeping the side nav bar tidy,

## What's Next?

Like I said I'm still working on these, but I already have more things I like to add like linking the games, anime etc to their official pages for those of you who are curios who want to know more and adding a see also section to link articles or posts that mention it.

For now I hope this was helpful if your thinking of doing something similar. If you checked my backlog page you may have noticed that I've been watching Mobile Suit Gundam GquuuuX and I've been enjoying it greatly! Currently taking notes and I plan on writing a post about it next month. Stay tuned!
