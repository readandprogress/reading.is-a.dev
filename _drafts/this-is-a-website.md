I've been mulling over the last couple of weeks, months even. About how I want to go about my site. I was very interested and looking forward to making it into something similar to a digital garden, but as I continue to work on this project I'm starting realize that I'm over complicating it with uneccesary additions that, in my opinion don't really add much value.

While I enjoy the process of adding these features, I don't particulary care to maintain them. So, I opted to simplify my site instead, just like I 've been aiming to do with a lot of aspects of my life. 

Which is for the best, as  I don't like a handful of features that makes it a so called "Digital Garden". I love greenary and fauna but I never was a huge fan of the green terminology that it's used, while novel I find it to be confusing for regular folk who barely know difference between a site or a blog much less a digital garden or any other kind of site.

Most people won't know what's a sapling is in regards to the web.
