As you may have noticed I have completely lean on tags and removed categories, while I don't want to go to deep here as I'm a writing post going over all the changes. I do want to express why briefly.

Which really just boils down to both doing practically the same job but in different ways and having both was just making my life more difficult for no reason. I also really like that I can branch out as much as like with tags but that's also its biggest weakness, so I'm trying to keep my tag list as minimal as possible.
