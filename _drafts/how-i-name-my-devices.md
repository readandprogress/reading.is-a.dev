I always found it fascinating what others name their computers and devices. Just like finding funny and unique Wi-Fi names, Is a small window into someones interests and personality.

So allow me to share my own!

As you can see if your are in the know, I name my devices with Gundam characters or in the case of smaller IoT and wearables, I named after a technology in the Gundam-verse.
