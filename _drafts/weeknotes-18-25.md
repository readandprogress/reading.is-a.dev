I'm back, slightly *later* than usual for my first installment of Weeknotes! Not gonna lie these couple of days have been pretty rough, but I think that makes this exercise even more worthwhile to me and others I'm sure. Sometimes you just need to stay up late to binging that new favorite anime of yours. or heavens **forbid** spending hours exploring every nook and cranny of a game. Couldn't be me lol. 

But, before I get to what I'm currently playing and watching, I have some updates about the site.
