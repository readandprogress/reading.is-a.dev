Now that Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX has finished airing, I thought it would be a great time for me to air some of thoughts and do I have a *lot* of them for this one. 

I mean how could you not? Is not everyday you to famed studios interconnect like this. 

When GQuuuuuuX was first announced I was floored by the idea of a Studio Khara working on Gundam series. I never consider the possibilty but I'm pleasantly suprised. Hideaki Anno the famed director and at the helm Studio Khara is know to be quite a Gundam fan and while directly involved with this new production, more in of a supporter role. There's still sign here and there of his involvement. 

And it shows! This series is very unlike the others, being the first alternate universe entry in the series. Depicting a alternate rality if somehow Zeon won the war. What if instead of Amuro, Char piloted the RX-78-2 Gundam?
