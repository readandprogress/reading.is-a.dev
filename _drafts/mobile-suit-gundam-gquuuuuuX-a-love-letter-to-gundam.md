Now that Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX has finished airing, I thought it would be a great time for me to air some of thoughts and do I have a *lot* of them for this one. 

I mean how could you not? Is not everyday you to famed studios interconnect like this. 

When GQuuuuuuX was first announced I was floored by the idea of a Studio Khara working on Gundam series. I never consider the possibilty but I'm pleasantly suprised. Hideaki Anno the famed director and at the helm Studio Khara is know to be quite a Gundam fan and while directly involved with this new production, more in of a supporter role. There's still sign here and there of his involvement. 

And it shows! This series is very unlike the others, being the first alternate universe entry in the series. Depicting a alternate rality wehere Zeon won the one year war. Where instead of Amuro, Char is the one who finds the Gundam. What with all that entail? That's what this entry spearheaded by passionate team aStudio Khara asks and overall it delivers a decent awnser but is not without its hicups. 

But lets not get ahead of ourselves here, lets go over why I'm left with this impression after watching it. Lets dive into the kir-kira and start from the beggining.  

Begining indeed, before GQuuuuuux was aired there was movie compilation of the first three episodes with added scenes. To be honest I haven't watch the movie yet but I am planning to, I figure as is just a compilation with some added scenes I'm not missing much. So with that said I only will be talking about the TV series if I miss anything that came from that movie this is why. :)

The first episode charminly enough starts off with our new main character Amate Yuzuriha or a by her nickname "Machu". Just like Witch from Mercury we have another female protagonist which is always welcomed.

Unlike Suletta this girl has spunk and a rebel of sorts but she isn't mean spirited and is willing to help others like our other female main character; Nyaan a reserved and aloof foreigner husting as a courier, which leads to the main plot point of the episode. She's deliviring a parcel containing a boot device; a device allowing the user to start a Mobile Suit, think like a key for your car. This parcel is mean't for another main charcater Shūji Itō; a scatterbrained and distant young boy
