## Notes

### Episode 01: The Beat of Emotion

Really enjoyed the first episode, I’m really impressed so far! I had the feeling this series was going to be darker than the norm, and I wasn't wrong! The first episode is focused on our main character Tomoru, and his weird ePulse; which is seemingly a kind of energy source for Sapotamas, which looks like this series’ Digivice. Reminds me of Digimon Savers/Data Squad’s Digisoul/DNA Charge.

“Digivice” may not be the most apt description, they seem to be able to do everything, kinda like a supercharged smartphone. Regardless, love the egg motif. Very fitting.

Now the ending, that ending…

I did not expect a death in the first episode.

Digimon never shies away from darker subjects, and deaths have been depicted before but never in the first episode! It really sets the tone for this series and I can’t wait to see what happens next, I’m hooked!


### Episode 02: Glowing Dawn

Another great episode! We get properly introduced to Glowing Dawn, and I must say I really like what they did here. Is nice to have a group not be all school kids, plus it adds to the whole misfits vibe they're going for. 

Asuka, Tomoro's older brother who I thought was killed the last episode, is in a comatose state, and there's a chance to save him. Giving Tomoru a clear goal.

Huh, the more I watch, the more I see similarities with Data Squad/ Savers and that can only be a good thing!
