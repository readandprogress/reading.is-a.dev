description: Sitting by himself in the back of the class, 10th-grader Yugi always had his head in some game--until he solved the Millennium Puzzle, an Egyptian artifact containing a powerful spirit from the age of the pharoahs! Awakened after three thousand years, the King of Games possesses Yugi, recklessly challenging bullies and evildoers to the Shadow Games, where the stakes are high, and even the most ordinary bet may result in weirdness and danger beyond belief! Let the games...begin!
