description: "Shoto Kazama, a boy who has never been able to win at card games because of his habit of giving up on things easily, enters the immersive world of Digimon Liberator through the invitation of his childhood friend, Arisa Kinosaki. The game allows players to engage in highly realistic card battles. At first, Shoto is hesitant towards it, but through his engrossing encounters with the Digimon there, he becomes a fan of the game. Encounters with wild Digimon such as Pteromon and battles with NPCs who have gone rogue. These various happenings set the wheels of fate in motion for Shoto and his companions. This is a story about Digimon, and their world."
