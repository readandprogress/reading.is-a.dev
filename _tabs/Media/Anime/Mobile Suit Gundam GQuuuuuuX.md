## Overview

*Universal Century 0085. Five years have passed since the end of the One Year War, which saw the Principality of Zeon proclaim victory, and Char Aznable and his gMS-α Red Gundam disappear in a mysterious phenomenon known as a Zeknova. After running into a girl named Nyaan, high schooler Amate Yuzuriha gets pulled from her quiet life on the Izuma colony at Side 6, into the world of illegal mobile suit dueling after getting into the cockpit of Zeon's new prototype Gundam, the gMS-Ω GQuuuuuuX.*

## Notes

> These notes may cointain spoilers.

{: .prompt-warning }

### Episode 1: The Red Gundam

- One thing to note when the episode started is the stylish animation and use of vibrant colors. Gundam has never look so saturated before and I'm must say I'm loving it!
- Seeing the ZEON converted White Base was a treat too as well as seeing some old faces in this AU retelling.
-  The Mobile Suit battles use 3D animation has its the norm now but the animation is good and fluid.
- We have another female protagonist which is always a welcome change.
- The new Gundam is very unique, need to get used to it.
- The music is really good as always and I enjoyed the ending, I haven't watch the opening yet but it imagine it would just as good or better.

### Episode 2: The White Gundam

-  Right away love that episode is in homage of the original series, very nostalgic!
- Seeing how Char got the Gundam was interesting, as this is were the timelines diverge.
- Happy for Char making a new friend in Challia Bull.
- The whole episode was flashback in more ways that one but it sets the setting pretty well.

### Episode 3: Mach in Clan Battle

- We get a look at clan battles, similar to duels in Witch of Mercury instead now battles are done in pairs.
- We are introduced to Shuji in this episode, he’s a odd fellow and Machu’s Mav in the clan battle. He seems to be able to tell what the Gundam is saying similar to Elan.
- Shuji has a Gundam with him: Char’s Gundam, how did he came to obtain it?
- Forgot to mention this earlier but the opening is pretty good! Very catchy, I like it.

### Episode 4: The Witch's War

-  We are introduced to an elite ace in the Federation army, aptly known as the “Witch”, who’s looking to settle the score with the Red Gundam and so is joining the clan battle to accomplish that feat.
- The Red Gundam took her Mav from her and so she’s justifiably looking to avenge her partner, even if it means losing her family due to it. Something that Machu has trouble understanding. Her obsession of the battlefield.
- In the end the Witch is beaten in the clan battle and with it her life is lost.
- I wonder if Char is fused with the Gundam somehow?

### Episode 5: Nyaan Doesn't Know About Kira-Kira 

- Shuji catches a cold so he isn’t able to help much with the upcoming clan battle, leaving Nyaan on her own.
-  In the battlefield Nyann awakens to her Newtype powers and wins the match. Thanks to being able to use the Omega Phychomu.
-  At the end of episode Machu finds Nyaan getting out of Gundam and is astonished.

### Episode 6: The Plot to Assassinate Kycilia

- Chalia Bull meets with the manager of the Pomenarians.
- We get the first mention of Amate's Dad.

### Episode 7: Machu's Rebelion

N/A

### Episode 8: Falling on the Moon

N/A

### Episode 9: The Rose of Charon

N/A

### Episode 10: Yomagn'tho Blockade

- Chalia was drawn to Char due to sharing the same emptiness in his heart huh? The bromance is strong in this one.
- Yeah, sure, giving a kid a gun has never gone wrong, ever! Wise choice, Chalia.
- Why would you two be in trouble? This is Gundam, everyone carries guns!
-  Kycilia poisons Gihren Zabi in this timeline, being a step ahead of Chalia and officially making her move. Things are about to get ugly.
- You too, Kycilia?! I was joking before, you know?
-  You sure did, Chalia; not your first nor the last mistake you made either.
- With that, Chalia Bull cemented himself as my favorite character in this series.
- I forgot to mention this before, but the Gundam FreD is so obviously a reference to Eva Unit 01 from Neon Genesis Evangelion. Studio Khara couldn't help themselves it seems.
- Another Zeknova?! A huge one at that, taking A Baoa Qu with it.

###  Episode 11: Alphacide

- Machu finds Nyaan operating the Gundam FreD. What a reunion!
- Machu is reunited with Shuji in spirit form. Did the Zeknova kill him? Regardless, Machu follows him.
- The blond guy from the Yomagn'tho development team is Char?! What a twist! I genuinely did not see that coming. One question remains: is he the real Char or just a clone?
- At last, Machu and Char meet.
- Nyaan follows suit, crashing through and almost crushing Kycilia.
- Char's scent reminds Machu of Shuji, kinda. Well, that's something.
- While Machu escapes, Kycilia aims at her with her rifle, but she stops before firing due to being shot in the arm by Nyaan. Maybe giving a kid a gun wasn't such a good idea?
- Char intends to destroy the Rose of Charon, killing Lalah with it. Machu tries to stop him, but sadly, no Machu vs. Char fight. Shuji intercepts them.
-  Lalah is waking up. What does that mean?
- Oh, another Zeknova, great...
- This time, instead of energy flowing out to the other side, energy is flowing in. Something is coming.
- Shuji is from the other side?! And his mission is to end the world she created.
- Wait, what does that mean?! Is she dreaming this world in her last moments or something?
- The RX-78 shows up coming from the Zeknova at the end. HYPE!
- We may see Amuro in the next episode. Someone has to piloting it unless is in auto pilot but that rarely happens in Gundam.
- Next episode is the finale, huh? I hope they can give a satisfactory ending. I feel like it should've been around 25 episodes to really flesh out the characters and have better pacing, but as they say, the ending is paramount. Maybe they can work a miracle.

### Episode 12: That's Why I...
