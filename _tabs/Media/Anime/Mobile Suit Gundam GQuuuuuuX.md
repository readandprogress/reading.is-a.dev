## Overview

*Universal Century 0085. Five years have passed since the end of the One Year War, which saw the Principality of Zeon proclaim victory, and Char Aznable and his gMS-α Red Gundam disappear in a mysterious phenomenon known as a Zeknova. After running into a girl named Nyaan, high schooler Amate Yuzuriha gets pulled from her quiet life on the Izuma colony at Side 6, into the world of illegal mobile suit dueling after getting into the cockpit of Zeon's new prototype Gundam, the gMS-Ω GQuuuuuuX.*

## Notes

### Episode 1

- One thing to note when the episode started is the stylish animation and use of vibrant colors. Gundam has never look so saturated before and I'm must say I'm loving it!

- Seeing the ZEON converted White Base was a treat too as well as seeing some old faces in this AU retelling.

-  The Mobile Suit battles use 3D animation has its the norm now but the animation is good and fluid.

- We have another female protagonist which is always a welcome change.

- The new Gundam is very unique, need to get used to it.

-  The music is really good as always and I enjoyed the ending, I haven't watch the opening yet but it imagine it would just as good or better.

### Episode 2

-  Right away love that episode is in homage of the original series, very nostalgic!

-  Seeing how Char got the Gundam was interesting, as this is were the timelines diverge.

-  Happy for Char making a new friend in Challia Bull.

-  The whole episode was flashback in more ways that one but it sets the setting pretty well.

### Episode 3

- We get a look at clan battles, similar to duels in Witch of Mercury instead now battles are done in pairs.

-  We are introduced to Shuji in this episode, he’s a odd fellow and Machu’s Mav in the clan battle. He seems to be able to tell what the Gundam is saying similar to Elan.

-  Shuji has a Gundam with him: Char’s Gundam, how did he came to obtain it?

-  Forgot to mention this earlier but the opening is pretty good! Very catchy, I like it.

### Episode 4

-  We are introduced to an elite ace in the Federation army, aptly known as the “Witch”, who’s looking to settle the score with the Red Gundam and so is joining the clan battle to accomplish that feat.

-  The Red Gundam took her Mav from her and so she’s justifiably looking to avenge her partner, even if it means losing her family due to it. Something that Machu has trouble understanding. Her obsession of the battlefield.

-  In the end the Witch is beaten in the clan battle and with it her life is lost.

-  I wonder if Char is fused with the Gundam somehow?

### Episode 5

- Machu is late for her Clan Battle so her friend substitutes for her in secret.

-  Shuji catches a cold so he isn’t able to help much with the upcoming clan battle, leaving Machu’s friend on her own.

-  In the battlefield her friend awakens to her Newtype powers and wins the match. Thanks to being able to use the Omega Phychomu.

-  At the end of episode Machu finds getting out of Gundam and is astonished.
