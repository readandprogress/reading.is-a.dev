  Hey there! I go by <a class="p-name" href="https://reading.is-a.dev/">Reading</a>.

I also enjoy writing fiction and would love to be a published author one day.

  To unwind I enjoy playing games, watching anime, reading manga and tinkering with hardware. if you like to get in contact with me just drop me a <a href="mailto:readandprogress@duck.com">email</a>!
 Is the best form of contacting someone online since everyone has one. :D

## Tech Stack

This site is a passion project of mine that I started early in 2023, Is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and has went through a variety of revisions, which I haven't done a good job of documenting...

But currently I'm using a modified version of the Jekyll [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) theme and I deploy to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), although I should start thinking of migrating to Workers instead but thats a problem for another day!

As for CI/Git, I'm still using [GitHub](https://github.com/) and personally don't feel a need to move to anything else for the time being. 

As for my subdomain I use a generous free subdomain registrar: [is-a.dev](https://is-a.dev/). 

All the pages on this site are written using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), specifically the GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) [standard](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). Although some pages may have some HTML, for certain features that Markdown lacks.

For the sake of transparency, this site doesn't cost me anything to maintain, every tool and service I use are generously offered for free! The only cost is my time, which I feel is very well spent working on this project. :)
